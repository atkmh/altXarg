The determinant of a square matrix A has the following properties:
 If any row or any column of A is zero, then det (A) = 0.
 The determinant of A is multiplied by  if the entries of any one row (or any one column) of A are all multiplied by .
 The determinant of A is unchanged if the entries in one row (respectively, column) are added to those in another row (respectively, column).
 The determinant of A equals the determinant of AT.
 The determinant of A is multiplied by - 1 if any two rows (respectively, columns) are exchanged.
Also, for any square matrices A and B, we have det (AB) = det(A) det(B).
