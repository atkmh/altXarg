CIS 385, Fall 92Object Oriented Programming in C++Programming Assignment 3: due Thursday, October 29The original assignment is too ambitious to be done as a single piece.Therefore I will break it into smaller parts.The first part, still due October 29, requires that you create three classes -a bunch class, an ordered bunch class, and a set class. The only elementsthat each of these classes will contain is a character, just like the setwe already created. Ordered bunch will be derived from class bunch. Class setwill be derived from class bunch.Class bunch will itself be derived from a class called unsafearray which Iwill provide. A working version is in this directory, but it is still missingdocumentation indicating what the functions do and how they are used. Iwill add those comments soon and update the copy that is available, and wewill  be using and discussing unsafearray in class.
