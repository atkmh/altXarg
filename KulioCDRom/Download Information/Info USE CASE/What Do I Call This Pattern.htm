<P>Someone was kind enough to send me this template for use cases using Access. 
&nbsp;It is not the same person or form as created the screen snapshot. &nbsp; 
<P>Personally, I do not work in Access, so I have not used either this form or 
the one with the screen snapshot. &nbsp;I include this database form on the site 
as a service for those of you wishing to work with use cases in Access. &nbsp;If 
you come up with a better form and are willing to share it with others, send it 
and I'll post it.

database (.zip file, 700KB)</A> 
<P>Here's the fix to the r:\ path problem, sent in by Rob Fowler. 
<P>Copy both UseCases.mdb and UsecasesBE.mdb to the same directory after 
unzipping. 
<P>1. While opening the UseCase.mdb from Access, hold down the shift key. This 
keeps the application from running. ( I opened it in Access 97 and converted it. 
The fix might work in Access 2.0 differently.) 
<P>2. Open the Linked Table Manager menu item from menu path: Tools.Add-Ins 
<P>3. Check the Radio Button at bottom of dialog box: Always Prompt for New 
Location. Click on Select All , OK 
<P>4. Once dialog box is open, highlight the UseCaseBE.mdb file. Then Click on 
Open. 
<P>5. Once all your files are re-linked to the correct directory, you can close 
the dialog box. 
<P>6. Close and Reopen to run application or open the form mnuMainMenu under 
forms tab. 
<P>I ran a couple of screens and they came up fine. Let me know how well it 
works as a use case tool.
