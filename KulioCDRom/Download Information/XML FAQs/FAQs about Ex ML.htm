<HR>

<DIV>
<H2><A name=FAQ-GENERAL>A. General questions</A></H2>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-ACRO>A.1 &nbsp; What is XML?</A></H3>
<P>XML is the `Extensible Markup Language' (extensible because it is not a fixed 
format like <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HTML">HTML</A>). It is designed 
to enable the use of <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SGML">SGML</A> on the 
World Wide Web.</P>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>XML is not a single, predefined markup language: it’s a 
metalanguage&nbsp;-- a language for describing other languages&nbsp;-- which 
lets you design your own markup. (A predefined markup language like HTML defines 
a way to describe information in one specific class of documents: XML lets you 
define your own customized markup languages for different classes of document.) 
It can do this because it’s written in SGML, the international standard 
metalanguage for markup.</FONT></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-DEF>A.2 &nbsp; What is XML for?</A></H3>
<P>XML is designed ‘to make it easy and straightforward to use <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SGML">SGML</A> on the Web: easy to define 
document types, easy to author and manage SGML-defined documents, and easy to 
transmit and share them across the Web.’</P>
<P>It defines ‘an extremely simple dialect of SGML which is completely described 
in the <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SPEC">XML Specification</A>. The goal 
is to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in 
the way that is now possible with <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HTML">HTML</A>.’</P>
<P>‘For this reason, XML has been designed for ease of implementation, and for 
interoperability with both SGML and HTML’ [quotes from <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SPEC">the XML spec</A>].</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-SGML>A.3 &nbsp; What is SGML?</A></H3>
<P>SGML is the <A href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgml-xml.html">Standard 
Generalized Markup Language</A> (<A href="http://www.iso.ch/">ISO 8879</A>), the 
international standard for defining descriptions of the structure and content of 
different types of electronic document. There is an SGML FAQ at <A 
href="http://www.infosys.utas.edu.au/info/sgmlfaq.txt"><TT>http://www.infosys.utas.edu.au/info/sgmlfaq.txt</TT></A> 
which is posted every month to the <SAMP>comp.text.sgml</SAMP> newsgroup, and 
the SGML Web pages are at <A 
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgml-xml.html"><TT>http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgml-xml.html</TT></A>.</P>
<P>ISO standards are governed by the International Organization for 
Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland, and voted into or out of existence by 
representatives from every country’s national standards body.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P>If you have a query about an international standard, you should contact 
  your national standards body for the name of your country’s representative on 
  the relevant ISO committee or working group.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>If you have a query about your country’s representation in Geneva or about 
  the conduct of your national standards body, you should contact the relevant 
  government department in your country, or speak to your public 
  representative.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The representation of countries at the ISO is not a matter for this FAQ. 
Please do not submit queries to the maintainer about how or why your ISO 
representatives have or have not voted.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-HTML>A.4 &nbsp; What is HTML?</A></H3>
<P>HTML is the <A href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp">HyperText Markup Language</A> 
(<A href="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1866.txt">RFC 1866</A>), a specific 
application of <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SGML">SGML</A> used on the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web</A>.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-SAME>A.5 &nbsp; Aren’t XML, SGML, and HTML all the same 
thing?</A></H3>
<P>Not quite. <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SGML">SGML</A> is the `mother 
tongue', used for describing thousands of different document types in many 
fields of human activity, from transcriptions of <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/celt/">ancient Irish manuscripts</A> to the <A 
href="http://web.deskbook.osd.mil/">technical documentation for stealth 
bombers</A>, and from <A 
href="http://www.mcis.duke.edu/standards/HL7/hl7frontpage.htm">patients’ 
clinical records</A> to <A href="http://www.tecno.com/smdl.htm">musical 
notation</A>.</P>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323><A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SGML">HTML</A> is 
just one of these document types, the one most frequently used in the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/">Web</A>. It defines a simple, fixed type of document

headings, paragraphs, lists, illustrations, <I>etc</I>, and some provision for

<P>XML is an abbreviated version of SGML, to make it easier for you to define 
your own document types, and to make it easier for programmers to write programs 
to handle them. It omits the more complex and less-used parts of SGML in return 
for the benefits of being easier to write applications for, easier to 
understand, and more suited to delivery and interoperability over the Web. But 
it is still SGML, and XML files may still be parsed and validated the same as 
any other SGML file (see the question on <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-XMLSOFT">XML software</A>).</P>
<P>Programmers may find it useful to think of XML as being SGML<SUP>--</SUP> 
rather than HTML<SUP>++</SUP>.</P></DIV>

<H3><A name=LANGS>A.6 &nbsp; What is the difference between SGML/XML and C or 
C<SUP>++</SUP>?</A></H3>
<P>C and C<SUP>++</SUP> (and others like Fortran, or Pascal, or Basic, or Java 
or dozens more) are <EM>programming languages</EM> with which you specify 
calculations, actions, and decisions to be carried out:</P>

<H3><A name=FAQ-OWNS>A.7 &nbsp; Who is responsible for XML?</A></H3>
<P>XML is a project of the <A href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C)</A>, and the development of the specification is being 
supervised by their XML Working Group. A Special Interest Group of co-opted 
contributors and experts from various fields contributed comments and reviews by 
email.</P>
<P>XML is a public format: it is not a proprietary development of any company. 
<A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SPEC">The v1.0 specification</A> was 
accepted by the W3C as Recommendation on Feb 10, 1998.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-IMPORT>A.8 &nbsp; Why is XML such an important 
development?</A></H3>
<P>It removes two constraints which are holding back Web developments:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>dependence on a single, inflexible document type (<A 
  href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HTML">HTML</A>);</P>
  <LI>
  <P>the complexity of full <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SGML">SGML</A>, 
  whose syntax allows many powerful but hard-to-program options.</P></LI></OL>
<P>XML simplifies the levels of optionality in SGML, and allows the development 
of user-defined document types on the Web.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-HOWTO>A.9 &nbsp; How can XML make SGML simpler and still let you 
define your own document types?</A></H3>
<P>To make SGML simpler, XML redefines some of <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SGML">SGML</A>’s internal values and 
parameters, and removes a large number of the more complex and sometimes 
less-used features which made it harder to write processing programs (see <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-sgml-xml-971215"><TT>http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-sgml-xml-971215</TT></A>).</P>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Although it retains all of SGML’s structural abilities 
which let you define and manage your own document types, XML introduces a new 
class of document which does not require you to use a <EM>predefined</EM> 
document type description (basically you can make up your own markup so long as 
you stick strictly to the syntactic rules). See the questions about <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-VALIDWF">‘valid’ and ‘well-formed’ 
documents</A>, and <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SELFDEF">how to define

<H3><A name=FAQ-EXTEND>A.10 &nbsp; Why not just carry on extending 
HTML?</A></H3>
<P><A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HTML">HTML</A> is already overburdened 
with dozens of interesting but often incompatible inventions from different 
manufacturers, because it provides only one way of describing your 
information.</P>
<P>XML will allow groups of people or organizations to create their own 
customized markup languages for exchanging information in their domain (music, 
chemistry, electronics, hill-walking, finance, surfing, petroleum geology, 
linguistics, cooking, knitting, stellar cartography, history, engineering, 
rabbit-keeping, <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-MATH">mathematics</A>, 
<I>etc</I>).</P>
<P>HTML is at the limit of its usefulness as a way of describing information, 
and while it will continue to play an important role for the content it 
currently represents, many new applications require a more robust and flexible 
infrastructure. </P></DIV>

<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Information on a network which connects many different

afford to be restricted to one make or model or manufacturer, or to cede control 
of its data format to private hands. It is also helpful for such information to 
be in a form that can be reused in many different ways, as this can minimize 
wasted time and effort. Proprietary data formats, no matter how well documented 
or publicized, are simply not an option: their control still resides in private 
hands and they can be changed or withdrawn arbitrarily without 
notice.</FONT></P>

<P>Remember the <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SPEC">XML specification</A> 
is still new, so a lot of what you see now is experimental. As with <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HTML">HTML</A>, there won’t be just one 
browser, but many. However, because the potential number of different XML 
applications is not limited, no single browser can be expected to handle 100% of 
everything.</P>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Some of the generic parts of XML (<I>eg</I> parsing, 
tree management, searching, formatting, <I>etc</I>) are being combined into 
general-purpose browser libraries or toolkits to make it easier for <A

line when writing XML applications. Such applications can then be customized by 
adding semantics for specific markets, or using languages like <CITE>Java</CITE>

<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>No. XML itself does not replace <A

expected to remain in common use for some time to come, and <A

<H3><A name=FAQ-XMLDOC>C.2 &nbsp; What does an XML document look like 
inside?</A></H3>
<P>The basic structure is very similar to most other applications of SGML, 
including HTML. XML documents can be very simple, with no document type 
declaration, and straightforward nested markup of your own design:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;conversation&gt;
  &lt;greeting&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/greeting&gt;
  &lt;response&gt;Stop the planet, I want to get off!&lt;/response&gt;
&lt;/conversation&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Or they can be more complicated, with a DTD specified (see <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-DOCTYPE"></A>), and maybe an internal subset, 
and a more complex structure:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE titlepage SYSTEM "http://www.frisket.org/dtds/typo.dtd" 
[&lt;!ENTITY % active.links "INCLUDE"&gt;]&gt;
&lt;titlepage&gt;
  &lt;white-space type="vertical" amount="36"/&gt;
  &lt;title font="Baskerville" size="24/30" 
         alignment="centered"&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;white-space type="vertical" amount="12"/&gt;
  &lt;!-- In some copies the following decoration is 
        hand-colored, presumably by the author --&gt;
  &lt;image location="http://www.foo.bar/fleuron.eps" type="URL" alignment="centered"/&gt;
  &lt;white-space type="vertical" amount="24"/&gt;
  &lt;author font="Baskerville" size="18/22" style="italic"&gt;Vitam capias&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;/titlepage&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Or they can be anywhere between: a lot will depend on how you want to define 
your document type (or whose you use) and what it will be used for. See the

<H3><A name=FAQ-SPACE>C.3 &nbsp; How does XML handle white-space in my

<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>The SGML rules regarding white-space have been changed 
for XML, so <EM>all</EM> white-space, including linebreaks, TAB characters, and 
regular spaces, <EM>even between elements where no text can appear</EM>, is 
passed by the parser <EM>unchanged</EM> to the application (browser, formatter, 
viewer, <I>etc</I>). This means:</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P>`insignificant' white-space between structural elements (those which appear 
  where only element content is allowed, <I>ie</I> between other elements, 
  without text data) <EM>will</EM> get passed to the application (under standard 
  SGML this white-space gets suppressed, which is why you can put all that extra 
  space in HTML documents and not worry about it. This is not so in XML);</P>
  <LI>
  <P>`significant' white-space within elements which <EM>can</EM> contain text 
  and markup mixed together (‘mixed content’ or PCDATA [parsed character data]) 
  will still get passed to the application exactly as under regular 
  SGML.</P></LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;chapter&gt;

    &lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/chapter&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>The parser must, however, still inform the application 
that white-space has occurred in element content, if it can detect it. (Users of 
standard SGML may recognize that this information was not in the <A 
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/WG8-n931a.html">ESIS</A>, but it 
<EM>is</EM> in the <A 
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/topics.html#groves">grove</A>.) In the 
above example, the application will receive all the pretty-printing linebreaks, 
TABs, and spaces between the elements <EM>as well as</EM> those embedded in the 
section title. It is the function of the application (browser, formatter, 
viewer, <I>etc</I>) to decide which type of white-space to discard and which to 
retain.</FONT></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-CASE>C.4 &nbsp; Which parts of an XML document are 
case-sensitive?</A></H3>
<P>All of it, both markup <EM>and</EM> text. This is significantly different 
from HTML and most other SGML document types. It was introduced to allow markup 
in non-Latin-alphabet languages and to obviate problems with case-folding in 
scripts which are caseless.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P>Element type names (used in start-tags and end-tags) are case-sensitive: 
  you must stick with whatever combination of upper- or lower-case you use to 
  define them (either by usage or in a <A

<H3><A name=FAQ-EXIST>C.5 &nbsp; How can I make my existing HTML files work in 
XML?</A></H3>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Make them <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-WF">well-formed</A> DTD-less documents (see 
below) and write a stylesheet. A <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-DOCTYPE">DTD (Document Type Description)</A> is 
optional in XML, but HTML files converted to XML format currently have to be 
DTDless because there are few working XML versions of the current SGML-based 
HTML DTDs yet (they need to be substantially edited to remove their dependence 
on those features of SGML which are excluded from XML).</FONT></P>
<P>It is necessary to convert existing HTML files to be well-formed because XML 
does not allow end-tag minimization (missing <CODE>&lt;/p&gt;</CODE>, 
<I>etc</I>) which is allowed in most HTML DTDs. Many HTML authoring tools 
already produce almost (but not quite) well-formed XML. As a preparation for 
XML, the W3C’s <A href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">HTML Tidy</A> 
program can clean up some of the formatting mess left beind by inadequate HTML 
editors.</P>
<P>If you want to move your files out of HTML into some other DTD entirely, 
there is a pilot site run by CommerceNet (<A 
href="http://www.xmlx.com/"><TT>http://www.xmlx.com/</TT></A>) for the exchange 
of XML DTDs, and a pilot FPI server at <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/public"><TT>http://www.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/public</TT></A> 
with several common SGML DTDs to start from.</P>
<P>If you have created your <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HTML">HTML</A> 
files conforming to one of the several HTML <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-DOCTYPE">Document Type Definitions (DTDs)</A>, 
and they validate OK, then they can be converted as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P>replace the <CODE>DOCTYPE</CODE> declaration and any internal subset 
  (basically everything within the first set of angled brackets 
  <CODE>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML...&gt;</CODE>) with the XML Declaration <CODE>&lt;?xml 
  version="1.0" standalone="yes"?&gt;</CODE></P>
  <LI>
  <P>change any <CODE>EMPTY</CODE> elements (<I>eg</I> 
  <CODE>&lt;ISINDEX&gt;</CODE>, <CODE>&lt;BASE&gt;</CODE>, 
  <CODE>&lt;META&gt;</CODE>, <CODE>&lt;LINK&gt;</CODE>, 
  <CODE>&lt;NEXTID&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;RANGE&gt;</CODE> in the header, and

  alt="Picture"/&gt;</CODE></P>
  <LI>
  <P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>ensure there are correctly-matched explicit end-tags 
  for all non-empty elements; <I>eg</I> every <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE> must have a 
  <CODE>&lt;/P&gt;</CODE>, <I>etc</I>. If your HTML was created by a conformant 
  editor, this process can be automated by a normalizer program like 
  <CITE>sgmlnorm</CITE> (part of <A 
  href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/"><CITE>SP</CITE></A>) or the 
  <SAMP>sgml-normalize</SAMP> function in an editor like 
  <CITE>Emacs</CITE>/<CITE>psgml</CITE>;</FONT></P>
  <LI>
  <P>escape all <CODE>&lt;</CODE> and <CODE>[amp ]</CODE> non-markup (<I>ie</I>

  <LI>
  <P>ensure all attribute values are in quotes;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>ensure all occurrences of all element names in start-tags <EM>and</EM> 
  end-tags match with respect to upper- and lower-case and that they are 
  consistent throughout the file;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>ensure all attribute names are similarly in a consistent case throughout 
  the file.</P></LI></UL>
<P>Be aware that many HTML browsers may not accept XML-style <CODE>EMPTY</CODE> 
elements with the trailing slash, so the above changes may not be 
backwards-compatible. An alternative is to add a dummy end-tag to all 
<CODE>EMPTY</CODE> elements, so <CODE>&lt;IMG src="foo.gif"&gt;</CODE> becomes 
<CODE>&lt;IMG src="foo.gif"&gt;</CODE><CODE>&lt;/IMG&gt;</CODE>.</P>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>If you have a lot of valid HTML files, could write a 
script to do this in a programming language which understands SGML/XML markup 
(such as <CITE><A href="http://www.omnimark.com/">Omnimark</A></CITE>, <CITE><A 
href="http://www.balise.com/">Balise</A></CITE>, <CITE><A 
href="http://www.dircon.co.uk/sgml/">SGMLC</A></CITE>, or a system using one of 
the SGML libraries for <CITE>Perl</CITE>, <CITE>Python</CITE>, or 
<CITE>Tcl</CITE>), or you could even use editor macros if you know what you’re 
doing.</FONT></P>
<P>If your HTML files are invalid (HTML created by most WYSIWYG editors is 
invalid) then they will almost certainly have to be converted manually, although 
if the deformities are regular and carefully constructed, the files may actually 
be almost well-formed, and you could write a program or script to do as 
described above. To test for invalidity and non-conformance, check the 
following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P>do the files contain markup syntax errors? For example, are there any 
  backslashes instead of forward slashes on end-tags; or elements which nest 
  incorrectly (<I>eg</I> <CODE>&lt;B&gt;an element which starts &lt;I&gt;inside 
  one element&lt;/B&gt; but ends outside it&lt;/I&gt;</CODE>)?</P>
  <LI>
  <P>do the files contain markup which conflicts with the HTML DTDs, such as 
  headings inside paragraphs, list items outside list environments?</P>
  <LI>
  <P>do the files use elements which are not in any DTD? Although this is easy 
  to transform to a DTDless well-formed file (because you don’t have to define 
  elements in advance) most proprietary [browser-specific] extensions have never 
  been formally defined, so it is often impossible to work out where they can 
  meaningfully be used.</P></LI></UL>
<P>Markup which is valid but which is meaningless or void may need to be edited 
out before conversion (such as repeated empty paragraphs or linebreaks, empty 
tables, invisible `spacing' GIFs <I>etc</I>: XML uses stylesheets, so you won’t 
need any of these).</P>
<P>See the <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-WF">rules for `well-formed' XML 
files</A> for details of what you need to check in XML when 
converting.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=HTMLXML>C.6 &nbsp; Is there an XML version of HTML?</A></H3>
<P>There are XML versions of the HTML DTD in preparation but none ready yet:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P><A href="mailto:btrafford@worldnet.att.net">Ben Trafford</A> is developing 
  an XML version of HTML 3.2</P>
  <LI>
  <P>I have started work on an XML version of HTML Pro, but it’s not easy, and I 
  need convincing it’s worth doing.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">Extensible HyperText Markup 
  Language</A> (XHTML) is a W3C project: ‘This specification defines XHTML 1.0, 
  a reformulation of HTML 4.0 as an XML 1.0 application, and three DTDs 
  corresponding to the ones defined by HTML 4.0. The semantics of the elements 
  and their attributes are defined in the W3C Recommendation for HTML 4.0. These 
  semantics provide the foundation for future extensibility of XHTML. 
  Compatibility with existing HTML user agents is possible by following a small 
  set of guidelines.’</P></LI></UL></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-SUBSET>C.7 &nbsp; If XML is just a subset of SGML, can I use XML 
files directly with SGML tools?</A></H3>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Yes, provided you use SGML software which knows about 
the new WebSGML Adaptations to ISO 8879 (features needed to support XML, such as 
the special form for <CODE>EMPTY</CODE> elements; some aspects of the SGML 
Declaration such as <CODE>NAMECASE GENERAL NO</CODE>; multiple attribute 
declarations, <I>etc</I>).</FONT></P>
<P>¶ <FONT color=#23238e>An alternative is to use an SGML DTD to let you create 
an SGML file, but one which does not use empty elements; and then remove the 
DocType Declaration so it becomes a well-formed DTDless XML file.</FONT></P>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>At the moment there are few tools which handle XML 
files unchanged because of the format of these <CODE>EMPTY</CODE> elements, but 
this is changing. The <CITE>nsgmls</CITE> parser has an XML conformance switch, 
introduced for use with <CITE>Jade</CITE>, and the first XML-specific editors 
and parsers are in use (see the question on <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-XMLSOFT">software</A>).</FONT></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-LEARN>C.8 &nbsp; I’m used to authoring and serving HTML. Can I 
learn XML easily?</A></H3>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Yes, very easily, but at the moment there is still a 
need for tutorials, simple tools, and more examples of XML documents. <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-WF">Well-formed</A> XML documents may look 
similar to <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HTML">HTML</A> except for some 
small but very important points of syntax.</FONT></P>
<P>¶ <FONT color=#23238e>The big practical difference is that XML has to stick 
to the rules. HTML browsers let you create broken HTML because they elide all 
the broken bits: with XML your files have to be correct or they simply won’t 
work.</FONT></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-CHARENTS>C.9 &nbsp; Will XML be able to use non-Latin 
characters?</A></H3>
<P>Yes, the <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SPEC">XML Specification</A> 
explicitly says XML uses <A href="http://www.iso.ch/">ISO 10646</A>, the 
international standard 31-bit character repertoire which covers most human (and 
some non-human) languages. This is currently congruent with Unicode.</P>
<P>The spec says (2.2): ‘All XML processors must accept the UTF-8 and UTF-16 
encodings of ISO 10646...’. UTF-8 is an encoding of Unicode into 8-bit 
characters: the first 128 are the same as ASCII, the rest are used to encode the 
rest of Unicode into sequences of between 2 and 6 bytes. UTF-8 in its 
single-octet form is therefore the same as ISO 646 IRV (ASCII), so you can 
continue to use ASCII for English or other unaccented languages using the Latin 
alphabet. Note that UTF-8 is incompatible with ISO 8859-1 (ISO Latin-1) after 
code point 126 decimal (the end of ASCII). UTF-16 is like UTF-8 but with a 
scheme to represent the next 16 planes of 64k characters as two 16-bit 
characters.</P>
<P>‘...the mechanisms for signalling which of the two are in use, and for 
bringing other encodings into play, are [...] in the discussion of character 
encodings.’ The <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SPEC">XML Specification</A> 
explains how to specify in your XML file which coded character set you are 
using.</P>
<P>Use of UCS-4 can only legally be specified in SGML or XML when the WebSGML 
Adaptations to ISO 8879 are implemented: this enables numbers longer than eight 
digits to be used in the SGML Declaration.</P>
<P>‘Regardless of the specific encoding used, any character in the ISO 10646 
character set may be referred to by the decimal or hexadecimal equivalent of its 
bit string’: so no matter which character set you personally use, you can still 
refer to specific individual characters from elsewhere in the encoded repertoire 
by using <CODE>&amp;#dddd;</CODE> (decimal character code) or 
<CODE>&amp;#xHHHH;</CODE> (hexadecimal character code, in uppercase). The 
terminology can get confusing, as can the numbers: see the <A 
href="http://cns-web.bu.edu/pub/djohnson/web_files/i18n/ISO-10646.html">ISO 
10646 Concept Dictionary</A>. Rick Jelliffe has <A

character entity sets</A>.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-DOCTYPE>C.10 &nbsp; What’s a Document Type Definition (DTD) and 
where do I get one?</A></H3>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>A DTD is a file (or several files to be used together), 
written in XML, which contains a formal definition of a particular type of 
document. It sets out what names can be used for element types, where they may 
occur, and how they all fit together. For example, if you want a document type 
to be able to describe <CODE>&lt;List&gt;</CODE>s which contain 
<CODE>&lt;Item&gt;</CODE>s, part of your DTD would contain something like</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;!ELEMENT List (Item)+&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT Item (#PCDATA)&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This fragment defines a list as an element type containing one or more items 
(that’s the plus sign), and items as element types containing just text. XML is 
the formal specification language which processors read to automatically parse 
the DTD and then use that information to identify where every element type comes 
and how each relates to the other, so that stylesheets, navigators, browsers, 
search engines, databases, printing routines, and other applications can be 
used. The above fragment lets you create lists which get stored as:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;List&gt;&lt;Item&gt;Chocolate&lt;/Item&gt;&lt;Item&gt;Music&lt;/Item&gt;&lt;Item&gt;Surfing&lt;/Item&gt;&lt;/List&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>How the list appears in print or on the screen depends on your stylesheet: 
you do not normally need to put anything in the XML to affect formatting in the 
way that had to be done with HTML before stylesheets.</FONT></P>
<P>In effect, a DTD provides applications with advance notice of what names and 
structures can be used in a particular document type. Using a DTD means you can 
be certain that all documents which belong to a particular type will be 
constructed and named in a conformant manner.</P>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323><A name=FAQ-SELFDEF>»</A>There are thousands of SGML 
DTDs already in existence in all kinds of areas (see the <A 
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgml-xml.html">SGML Web pages</A> for 
examples). Many of them can be downloaded and used freely; or you can write your 
own. As with any language, you need to learn it to do this (see for example 
<CITE>Developing SGML DTDs</CITE> by Maler and el Andaloussi, Prentice Hall, 
1997, 0-13-309881-8): but XML is much simpler than full SGML: see the <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-RESTRICT">list of restrictions</A> which shows 
what has been cut out. Existing SGML DTDs do need to be converted to XML for use 
with XML systems: <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-DTDCONV">read the question 
on converting SGML DTDs to XML</A>, and expect to see announcements of popular 
DTDs eventually becoming available in XML format.</FONT></P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=SCHEMATA>C.11 &nbsp; I keep hearing about alternatives to DTDs. 
What’s a schema?</A></H3>
<P>Bob DuCharme writes: ‘Many XML developers are dissatisfied with the syntax of 
the markup declarations described in the XML spec for two reasons. First, they 
feel that if XML documents are so good at describing structured information, 
then the description of a document type’s structure (its `schema') should be in 
an XML document instead of written with its own special syntax. In addition to 
being more consistent, this would make it easier to edit and manipulate the 
schema with regular document manipulation tools. Secondly, they feel that 
traditional DTD notation doesn’t allow schema designers the power to impose 
enough constraints on the data&nbsp;-- for example, the ability to say that a 
certain element type must always have a positive integer value, that it may not 
be empty, or that it must be one of a list of possible choices. This would ease 
the development of software using that data because the developer would have 
less error-checking code to write.’</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note</B> 
  <P>Users from a database or computer science background should be aware that 
  SGML systems&nbsp;-- and that includes XML&nbsp;-- are not database management 
  systems: they are text markup systems. While there are many similarities, such 
  as the ones described here, some of the concepts of one are simply 
  non-existent in the other: XML does not possess some database-like features in 
  the same way that DBMSs do not possess markup-like ones.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>‘Several groups have submitted proposals to the W3C for alternative ways to 
express document type schemata. In addition to offering schema constraints like 
data typing and the others described here, many take advantage of other current 
trends in software development such as object-oriented methodologies. The W3C 
Schema Working Group is currently reviewing these proposals and developing their 
own proposal based on the most useful features suggested by the existing 
proposals and the members of the Working Group.’</P></DIV>

<H3><A name=FAQ-HYPERTEXT>C.12 &nbsp; How will XML affect my document

<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>The linking abilities of XML systems are much more 
powerful than those of HTML, so you’ll be able to do much more with them. 
Existing <CODE>HREF</CODE>-style links will remain usable, but the new linking 
technology is based on the lessons learned in the development of other standards 
involving hypertext, such as <A href="http://www-tei.uic.edu/orgs/tei/">TEI</A> 
and <A href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/hytime.html">HyTime</A>, which let 
you manage bidirectional and multi-way links, as well as links to a span of text 
(within your own or other documents) rather than to a single point. These 
features have been available to standard SGML users in browsers like 
<CITE>DynaText</CITE>, <CITE>Panorama</CITE> and <CITE>Multidoc Pro</CITE> for 
many years, so there is considerable experience and expertise available in using 
them.</FONT></P>
<P>The <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xlink">XML Linking Specification 
(XLink)</A> and <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-xptr">XML Extended Pointer 
Specification (XPointer)</A> documents contain a detailed draft specification. 
An XML link can be either a URL or a TEI-style Extended Pointer (<A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#LOC2" id=LOC1 name=LOC1>XPointer</A>), or both. A 
URL on its own is assumed to be a resource (as with HTML); if an XPointer 
follows it, it is assumed to be a sub-resource of that URL; an XPointer on its 
own is assumed to apply to the current document.</P>
<P>An XPointer is always preceded by one of <TT>#</TT>, <TT>?</TT>, or 
<TT>|</TT>. The <TT>#</TT> and <TT>?</TT> mean the same as in HTML applications; 
the <TT>|</TT> means the sub-resource can be found by applying the XPointer to 
the resource, but the method of doing this is left to the application.</P>
<P>The <A href="http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV2;id=SAXR">TEI 
Extended Pointer Notation</A> (EPN) is much more powerful than the `fragment 
address' on the end of some URLs, as it allows you to specify the location of a 
link end using the structure of the document as well as (or in addition to) 
known, fixed points like IDs. For example, <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#LOC1" 
id=LOC2 name=LOC2>the linked second occurrence of the word `XPointer' two 
paragraphs back</A> could be referred to as 
<SAMP>http://www.ucc.ie/xml/faq.sgml#ID(faq-hypertext)CHILD(2,*)(6,*)</SAMP>,

<H3><A name=FAQ-META>C.14 &nbsp; How does XML handle metadata?</A></H3>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Because XML lets you define your own markup language, 
you can make full use of the extended hypertext features (see the question on <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HYPERTEXT">Links</A>) of XML to store or link 
to metadata in any format (<I>eg</I> ISO&nbsp;11179, <A 
href="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core/">Dublin Core, Warwick 
Framework</A>, <A href="http://www.dstc.edu.au/RDU/RDF/">Resource Description 
Framework (RDF)</A>, and <A href="http://www.w3.org/PICS/">Platform for Internet 
Content Selection (PICS)</A>).</FONT></P>
<P>There are no predefined elements in XML, because it is an architecture, not 
an application, so it is not part of XML’s job to specify how or if authors 
should or should not implement metadata. You are therefore free to use any 
suitable method from simple attributes to the embedding of entire Dublin 
Core/Warwick Framework metadata records. Browser makers may also have their own 
architectural recommendations or methods to propose.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-JAVA>C.15 &nbsp; Can I use Java, ActiveX, <I>etc</I> in XML 
files?</A></H3>
<P>This depends on what facilities the browser makers implement. XML is about 
describing information; scripting languages and languages for embedded 
functionality are software which enables the information to be manipulated at 
the user’s end.</P>
<P>XML itself provides a way to define the markup needed to implement scripting 
languages: as a neutral standard it neither encourages not discourages their 
use, and does not favour one language over another, so the field is wide open. 
</P>
<P>Scripting languages <EM>are</EM> provided for in a proposal for an <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-XSL-970910">Extensible Style Language, XSL</A>

<H3><A name=JAVA-GEN>C.16 &nbsp; Can I use Java to create or manage XML

programming environments and data management environments to automate this.</P>

browsers may possibly provide simple default styles for popular elements like 
<CODE>&lt;Para&gt;</CODE>, or <CODE>&lt;List&gt;</CODE> containing

better control of the layout. But as with any system where files can be viewed

fonts) are on the user’s system, so care is needed.</FONT></P>

<H3><A name=FAQ-GRAPH>C.18 &nbsp; How do I use graphics in XML?</A></H3>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Graphics are just links which happen to have a picture 
file at the end rather than another piece of text, so they can be done in any 
way supported by the XLink and XPointer specifications (see <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HYPERTEXT">earlier question</A>), including 
using similar syntax to existing HTML images. They can also be done using XML’s 
built-in <CODE>NOTATION</CODE> and <CODE>ENTITY</CODE> mechanism in a similar 
way to standard SGML. The linking specifications, however, give you much better 
control over the traversal and activation of links, so an author can specify, 
for example, whether or not to have an image appear when the page is loaded, or 
on a click from the user, or in a separate window, <EM>without having to resort 
to scripting</EM>. Which graphic file formats will be supported is a matter for 
the browser makers: XML itself doesn’t predict or restrict you. GIF, JPG, TIFF, 
PNG, and CGM at a minimum would seem to make sense: there are moves towards 
creating a networked vector graphics standard (see next paragraph).</FONT></P>
<P>Peter Murray-Rust writes: ‘GIFs and JPEGs cater for bitmaps (pixel 
representations of images). Vector graphics (scaleable) are being addressed in 
the W3C’s graphics activity (see <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/Activity"><TT>http://www.w3.org/Graphics/Activity</TT></A>). 
When a consensus is reached it will be possible to transmit the graphics 
representation <EM>within the XML file</EM>. For many graphics objects this will 
mean greatly decreased download time and scaling without loss of detail.’</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note</B> 
  <P>You cannot embed a raw graphics file (or any other binary [non-text] data) 
  directly into an XML file because any bytes resembling markup would get 
  misinterpreted: you must refer to it by linking (see below).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Bob DuCharme adds: ‘All the data in an XML document entity must be parseable 
XML. You can define an external entity as either a parsed entity (parseable XML) 
or an unparsed entity (anything else). Unparsed entities can be used for picture 
files, sound files, movie files, or whatever you like. They can only be 
referenced from within a document as the value of an attribute (much like a 
bitmap picture on an HTML Web page is the value of the <CODE>img</CODE> 
element’s <CODE>src</CODE> attribute) and not part of the actual document. In an 
XML document, this attribute must be declared to be of type <CODE>ENTITY</CODE>, 
and the entity’s declaration must specify a declared <CODE>NOTATION</CODE>, 
because if the entity isn’t XML, the XML processor needs to know what it is. For 
example, in the following document, the <SAMP>colliepic</SAMP> entity is 
declared to have a JPEG notation, and it’s used as the value of the empty dog 
element’s <SAMP>picfile</SAMP> attribute.’</P>

<H3><A name=FAQ-VALIDWF>D.2 &nbsp; What are these terms `DTDless', `valid', and 
`well-formed'?</A></H3>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>Full SGML uses a Document Type Definition (DTD) to 
describe the markup (elements) available in any specific type of document. 
However, the design and construction of a DTD can be a complex and non-trivial 
task, so XML has been designed so it can be used either with or without a DTD. 
DTDless operation means you can invent markup without having to define it 
formally, at the penalty of losing automated control over the structuring of 
additional documents of the same type.</FONT></P>
<P>To make this work, a DTDless file in effect defines its own markup 
informally, by the simple existence and location of elements where you create 
them. But when an XML application such as a browser encounters a DTDless file, 
it needs to be able to understand the document structure <EM>while it reads 
it</EM>, because it has no DTD to tell it what to expect, so some changes have 
been made to the rules. </P>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>For example, HTML’s <CODE>&lt;IMG&gt;</CODE> element is 
defined as ‘<CODE>EMPTY</CODE>’: it doesn’t have an end-tag. An XML application 
reading a file <EM>without a DTD</EM> and encountering <CODE>&lt;IMG&gt;</CODE> 
would have no way to know whether or not to expect an end-tag, so the concept of 
`well-formed' files has become necessary. This makes the start and end of every 
element, and the occurrence of <CODE>EMPTY</CODE> elements completely 
unambiguous.</FONT></P>
<DIV>
<H4><A name=FAQ-WF>D.2.1 &nbsp; ‘Well-formed’ documents</A></H4>

  <P>David Brownell notes: ‘XML that’s `just' well-formed doesn’t <EM>need</EM>

  to permit certain speedups when processing documents while ignoring external 
  parameter entities&nbsp;-- basically, you can’t rely on external declarations

  elements</A>, see below);</P>
  <LI>
  <P>all attribute values must be in quotes (the single-quote character [the

  <CODE>&amp;quot;</CODE>, and declare them in the internal subset;</P>

  ‘<CODE>/&gt;</CODE>’ or you have to make them appear non-<CODE>EMPTY</CODE> by

  <CODE>&lt;BR/&gt;</CODE> or 
  <CODE>&lt;BR&gt;</CODE><CODE>&lt;/BR&gt;</CODE>.</P>

  <CODE>&amp;lt;</CODE> and <CODE>&amp;amp;</CODE>), and the sequence 
  <CODE>]]&gt;</CODE> must be given as <CODE>]][amp ]gt;</CODE> if it does not 
  occur as the end of a <CODE>CDATA</CODE> marked section;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>elements must nest inside each other properly (no overlapping markup, same

available for use even without a DTD. Valid XML files must declare them

<H3><A name=ATTRIBORELEM>D.3 &nbsp; Which should I use in my DTD, attributes or

<P>There is no single answer to this: a lot depends on what you are designing 
the document type for. The two extremes are best illustrated with examples.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P>`Traditional' textual practice is to put the `real' text (what would be 
  printed) as character data content, and keep the metadata (like line numbers) 
  in attributes, from where they can more easily be isolated for analysis or 
  special treatment like display in the margin or in a mouseover:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;l n="184"&gt;&lt;sp&gt;Portia&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;text&gt;The quality of mercy is not strain’d,&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/l&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI>
  <P>But from the systems point of view, there is nothing `wrong' with storing 
  the data the other way round, especially where the volume of text data on each 
  occasion is relatively small:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;line speaker="Portia" text="The quality of mercy is not strain’d,"&gt;184&lt;/line&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></UL>
<P>A lot will depend on what you want to do with the information and which bits 
of it are easiest accessed by each method. A rule of thumb for conventional 
textual documents is that if the markup were all stripped away, the bare text 
should still be readable and usable, even if inconvenient. For database output, 
however, or other machine-generated documents, `reading' may not be meaningful, 
so it is perfectly possible to have documents where <EM>all</EM> the data is in 
attributes, and the document contains no character data in content models at 
all. See <A

etc, which may need other MIME Content-Type entries, such as 
<SAMP>text/css</SAMP> for CSS stylesheets. XUA (XML User Agent), which is one of 
the planned deliverables of the XML WG, might provide a mechanism for packaging 
XML documents and XSL styles into a single message.</FONT></P>
<P>If you run scripts generating HTML, which you wish to work with XML, they 
will need to be modified to produce the relevant document type.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-SSINCLUDES>D.7 &nbsp; Can I still use server-side 
<CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>s?</A></H3>
<P>Yes, so long as what they generate ends up as part of an XML-conformant file 
(<I>ie</I> either <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-VALID">valid</A> or just 
<A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-WF">well-formed</A>).</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-CSINCLUDES>D.8 &nbsp; Can I (and my authors) still use 
client-side <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>s?</A></H3>
<P>The same rule applies as for <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SSINCLUDES">server-side 
<CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>s</A>, so you need to ensure that any embedded code which 
gets passed to a third-party engine (<I>eg</I> <CITE>SDQL</CITE> enquiries, 
<CITE>Java</CITE> <CODE>write</CODE>s, <CITE>LiveWire</CITE> requests, streamed 
content, <I>etc</I>) does not contain any characters which might be 
misinterpreted as XML markup (<I>ie</I> no angle brackets or ampersands): either 
use a <CODE>CDATA</CODE> marked section to avoid your XML application parsing 
the embedded code, or use the standard <CODE>&amp;lt;</CODE>, 
<CODE>&amp;gt;</CODE>, and <CODE>&amp;amp;</CODE> character entity references 
instead.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-TERMS>D.9 &nbsp; I’m trying to understand the XML Spec: why does 
SGML (and XML) have such difficult terminology?</A></H3>
<P>§ <FONT color=#8e2323>For implementation to succeed, the terminology needs to 
be precise. Design goal 8 of the specification tells us that ‘the design of XML 
shall be formal and concise’. To describe XML in formal terms, the specification 
uses the concise language of Computer Science, which is often confusing to 
non-CS people because it uses well-known English words in a specialised sense 
which can be very different from their commonly understood meanings&nbsp;-- for 
example, `grammar', `production', `token', or `terminal'.</FONT></P>
<P>The specification rarely explains these terms because of the other part of 
this design goal: the specification should be concise. It doesn’t repeat 
explanations that are available elsewhere. In essence this means that to grok 
the fullness of the spec, you need foreknowledge of computer science and 
SGML.</P>
<P>Sloppy terminology in specifications causes misunderstandings, so formal 
standards have to be phrased in formal terminology. This FAQ is not a formal 
document, and the astute reader may already have noticed it refers to `element 
names' where `element type names' is more correct; but the former is more widely 
understood.</P>
<P>Those new to <A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-SGML">SGML</A> may want to 
read something like the <CITE><A 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV1;id=SG">Gentle Introduction 
to SGML</A></CITE> chapter of the <A href="http://www.uic.edu/orgs/tei/">TEI</A> 
Guidelines.</P>
<P>Thanks to Bob DuCharme for suggestions and some bits from his <A 
href="http://www.snee.com/bob/xmlann">book on the XML Spec</A>.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-API>D.10 &nbsp; Is there a Developer’s API kit for XML?</A></H3>
<P>Several are available or under development. Details of these and other XML 
software are held on the <A 
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgml-xml.html">SGML/XML Web pages</A>.</P>
<P>The big conversion and application development engines like 
<CITE>Balise</CITE>, <CITE>Omnimark</CITE>, and <CITE>SGMLC</CITE> are all 
working on adding XML. Details of SGML software of all kinds is on <A 
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgml-xml.html">the SGML Web 
pages</A>.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-DOM>D.11 &nbsp; How does XML fit with the DOM?</A></H3>
<P>The Document Object Model (DOM) (<A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-DOM-Level-1"><TT>http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-DOM-Level-1</TT></A>) 
provides an abstract API for constructing, accessing, and manipulating XML and 
HTML documents. A ‘binding’ of the DOM to a particular programming language 
provides a concrete API.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-TEST>D.12 &nbsp; Is there a conformance test suite for XML 
processors?</A></H3>
<P>James Clark has a collection of test cases for testing XML parsers at <A 
href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/"><TT>http://www.jclark.com/xml/</TT></A> which 
includes a conformance test.</P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-INCLUDES>D.13 &nbsp; How do I include one DTD (or fragment) in 
another?</A></H3>
<P>This works exactly the same as for regular SGML. First you declare the entity 
you want to include, and then you reference it by name:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;!ENTITY % mylists PUBLIC 
         "-//Foo, Inc//ENTITIES Common list structures//EN"
         "dtds/listfrag.ent"&gt;
...
%mylists;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such declarations traditionally go all together towards the top of the main 
DTD file, where they can be managed and maintained, but this is not essential so 
long as they are declared before they are used. You use Parameter Entity syntax 
for this (the percent sign) because the file is to be included at DTD compile 
time, not when the document instance itself is parsed.</P>
<P>Note that a URL is compulsory in XML for all external file references: 
standard rules for dereferencing URLs apply (assume the same method, server, and 
directory as the containing document). The URL can be supplied either as a 
System Identifier alone:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;!ENTITY mydtd SYSTEM "http://www.foo.bar/~blort/my.dtd"&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or as a second parameter to a <A 
href="http://www.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/public">formal Public Identifier</A> as in the 
<A href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-VALID">earlier example</A>. </P></DIV>
<DIV>
<H3><A name=FAQ-DTDCONV>D.14 &nbsp; I’ve already got SGML DTDs: how do I convert 
them for use with XML?</A></H3>
<P>There are numerous projects being started to convert common or popular SGML 
DTDs to XML format (for example Patrice Bonhomme is working on an unofficial XML 
version of the TEI Lite DTD: details of that are discussed on the TEI-L mailing 
list).</P>
<P>The following checklist comes courtesy of Seán McGrath (author of <CITE>XML 
By Example</CITE>, Prentice Hall, 1998) <EM>[my italics]</EM>:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>No equivalent of the SGML Declaration. So keywords, character set 
  <I>etc</I> are essentially fixed;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Tag mimimization is not allowed, so <CODE>&lt;!ELEMENT x - O 
  (A,B)&gt;</CODE> becomes <CODE>&lt;!ELEMENT X (A,B)&gt;</CODE> and 
  <CODE>&lt;!ELEMENT x - O EMPTY&gt;</CODE> becomes <CODE>&lt;!ELEMENT X 
  EMPTY&gt;</CODE>;</P>
  <LI>
  <P><CODE>#PCDATA</CODE> must only occur extreme left in an <CODE>OR</CODE> 
  model, <I>eg</I><CODE>&lt;!ELEMENT x (A|B|#PCDATA|C)&gt;</CODE> becomes 
  <CODE>&lt;!ELEMENT x (#PCDATA|A|B|C)&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;!ELEMENT x 
  (A,#PCDATA)&gt;</CODE> is illegal;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>No <CODE>CDATA</CODE>, <CODE>RCDATA</CODE> elements <EM>[declared 
  content]</EM>;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Some SGML attribute types are not allowed in XML <I>eg</I> 
  <CODE>NUTOKEN</CODE>. Also there are no <CODE>NOTATION</CODE> attributes (data 
  attributes);</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Some SGML attribute defaults are not allowed in XML <I>eg</I> 
  <CODE>CONREF</CODE>;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Comments cannot be inline to declarations like <EM>[they can in standard 
  SGML]</EM> <CODE>&lt;!ELEMENT x (A,B) -- this is an SGML comment in a 
  declaration --&gt;</CODE>;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>A whole bunch of SGML optional features are not present in XML: <I>a</I>) 
  all forms of tag minimization (<CODE>OMITTAG</CODE>, <CODE>DATATAG</CODE>, 
  <CODE>SHORTREF</CODE>, <I>etc</I>); <I>b</I>) Link Process Definitions; 
  <I>c</I>) Multiple DTDs per document and many more: see <A 
  href="http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-HOWTO">the question on the bits of SGML that 
  were removed for XML</A> for a reference to the complete list;</P>
  <LI>
  <P>And last but not least, <CODE>CONCUR</CODE>! There are some important 
  differences betweeen the internal and external subset portion of a DTD in XML: 
  <I>a</I>) marked sections can only occur in the external subset <I>b</I>) 
  Parameter Entities must be used to replace entire declarations in the internal 
  subset portion of a DTD, <I>eg</I> the following is invalid XML:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><BODYTEXT><PRE><SMALL>&lt;!DOCTYPE x [
        &lt;!ENTITY % modelx "(A|B)*"&gt;
        &lt;!ELEMENT x %modelx;&gt;
        ]&gt;
        &lt;x&gt;&lt;/x&gt;</SMALL></PRE></BODYTEXT></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></OL></DIV>

<H3><A name=FAQ-EDI>D.15 &nbsp; What’s the story on XML and EDI?</A></H3>
<P>Electronic Document Interchange has been used in e-commerce for many years to 
exchange documents between commercial partners to a transaction. It has required 
special proprietary software, but there are now moves to enable EDI data to 
travel inside XML. Details of developments are at <A 
href="http://www.xmledi.com/"><TT>http://www.xmledi.com/</TT></A> and there is a 
guideline document at <A
