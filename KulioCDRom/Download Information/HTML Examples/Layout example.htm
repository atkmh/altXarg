      <H2><FONT color=#ffffcc>Abstract</FONT></H2><FONT color=#ffffcc>An 
      accident at the Sierra Chemical Company Kean Canyon plant, 16 km east of 
      Reno, Nevada, resulted in two explosions 3.52 seconds apart which 
      devastated the facility. An investigation into a possible cause for the 
      accident required the chronological order of explosions. We resolved the 
      high-precision relative locations and chronology of the explosions using a 
      cross-correlation method applied to both seismic and air-waves. The 
      difference in relative arrival times of air-waves between the explosions 
      indicated that the first explosion occurred at the northern site. We then 
      determined two station centroid separations between explosions which 
      average about 73 meters with uncertainties ranging from ± 17 to 41 meters 
      depending on the alignment of station pairs. We estimated a centroid 
      separation of 80 meters using P-waves with a larger uncertainty of ± 340 
      meters. We performed a grid search for an optimal separation and the 
      azimuth by combining air-wave arrivals from 3 station pairs. The best 
      solution for the relative location of the second explosion is 73.2 meters 
      S35°E from the first explosion. This estimate is well within the 
      uncertainties of the surveyed crater locations by the US Chemical Safety 
      and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB). The CSB reported a separation of 
      approximately 76.2 meters S33°E. The spectral amplitudes of P-waves are 3 
      to 4 times higher for the second explosion relative to the first explosion 
      but the air-waves have similar spectral amplitudes. We suggest that this 
      difference is due to the partitioning of energy between the ground and air 
      caused by downward directivity at the southern explosion, and upwards 
      directivity at the northern explosion. This is consistent with the absence 
      of a crater for the first explosion and a 1.8 meter deep crater for the 
      second explosion.&nbsp;</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>&nbsp;

      <H2>Introduction</H2>On the morning of January 7, 1998, two explosions 
      occurred 3.52 seconds apart at the Sierra Chemical Company facility, 16 km 
      east of Reno, Nevada. Unfortunately, four people lost their lives and six 
      more individuals were injured in the explosions that devastated the 
      facility. The US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB), 
      with the cooperation of several state agencies, initiated an investigation 
      into the cause of the accident. The chronological order of the explosions 
      was an important aspect of the investigation because it may help determine 
      the cause of the accident. The CSB requested that the Seismological 
      Laboratory independently estimate the chronology based on air and seismic 
      wave arrival times from seismograms to compare with other results obtained 
      by the CSB.&nbsp; 
      <P>The two explosions were recorded at several stations of the western 
      Great Basin seismic network and by 3-component, telemetered, digital 
      broadband stations (Figure 1). From these records, the estimated origin 
      time of the first explosion is 15:54:03.0 ± 0.3 sec UTC (7:54 AM local 
      time), with an approximate location of 39° 31.8'N, 119° 38.1'W (± 1.5 km). 
      However, based on a survey by the CSB, the location of the northern 
      crater's center is 39° 32.5'N, 119° 38.1'W (John Piatt, personal 
      communication). When treated as an earthquake, the coda magnitude of the 
      largest explosion is estimated to be M<SUB>d</SUB>2.&nbsp;</P></TD></TR>

    <TD align=left vAlign=top NOSAVE>An examination of the seismograms in 
      Figure (2a) show that there are two similar shaped P-wave arrivals (P1 and 
      P2) at station PAH separated in time by about 3.5 seconds. This is 
      followed by two similar shaped N-waves (N1 and N2) also separated in time 
      by about 3.5 seconds and arriving approximately 70 seconds after the 
      P-waves. The N-wave is created by the shock wave traveling in air 
      (Kanamori et al., 1991). The identification of these phases were based on 
      the phase arrivals which do not exhibit a distance moveout expected for 
      reflected air or seismic waves. The coherency between P- and N-waves also 
      indicates two explosions at the same location.&nbsp; 
      <P>The (P2) phase in Figure (2a) appears to be an S-wave of the initial 
      explosion but is actually the P-wave arrival from the second explosion 
      which is nearly coincident with the expected S-wave arrival from the 
      initial explosion at both PAH and WCN. The larger P-wave amplitudes for 
      the second explosion suggest that this was the larger of the two 
      explosions, although the S-waves from the initial explosion at both PAH 
      and WCN may contribute some 
interference.&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>&nbsp;

    <TD align=left vAlign=top NOSAVE>The CSB surveyed the accident site and 
      reported that two explosions were separated by a horizontal distance of 
      approximately 250 feet (76.2 meters), along a strike of 147° or S33°E 
      (John Piatt, personal communication). Uncertainties in these measurements 
      are due to uncertainty on where the "centers" of the explosions were 
      located. The northern explosion did not leave a crater and occurred in a 
      building that was formerly about 40 feet by 40 feet in dimension, and the 
      southern explosion left a kidney-shaped crater that was about 30 feet 
      across and 50 feet long (John Piatt, personal communication). A circular 
      approximation would have a radius of 40 feet. Based on these dimensions, 
      the separation between the centers of the explosions relative to the 
      centroid could be uncertain by as much as several meters, and the azimuth 
      could be uncertain by a few degrees. According to testimony to the CSB 
      (John Piatt, personal communication), there were about 7500 to 8000 pounds 
      of explosives (TNT or COMP-B) at the northern site, and about 15000 pounds 
      of explosives (PETN) at the southern site. Based on several independent 
      lines of evidence, the CSB has come to the conclusion that the northern 
      explosion occurred first.&nbsp; 
      <P>Poupinet et al. (1984), Fremont and Malone (1987), VanDecar and Crosson 
      (1990), Deichmann and Fernandez (1992), Dodge et al., (1996), and Lees 
      (1998) used a cross-correlation method on nearly identical seismograms 
      called multiplets for the high-precision relative hypocenter locations of 
      earthquakes. Fremont and Malone (1987) directly tested the precision of 
      this method with ground truth information from explosions and concluded 
      that explosions within 250 meters could be relocated with an accuracy 
      better than 20 meters. We have also observed numerous cases of multiplets 
      in routine earthquake monitoring activities and would like to determine 
      the resolving power and errors associated with this methodology for our 
      regional seismic network.&nbsp;</P></TD>

    <TD align=left vAlign=top NOSAVE>We located the initial explosion 
      (explosion A) from the P-wave arrivals recorded at the UNR Keck digital 
      stations and one helicorder record from an analog station (Table 1). The 
      existing regional network of analog stations did not trigger on the 
      explosion. We used a 1D velocity model (Table 2) to estimate the absolute 
      location of the first explosion. Since the location determined from the 
      P-wave arrivals of the first explosion is only 1.2 km from the known 
      mapped location of the explosions, our confidence in the velocity model in 
      Table 2 is increased.&nbsp; 
      <P>Finding the relative centroid locations of explosions A and B, requires 
      the precise time difference in P-wave or N-wave arrivals between 
      explosions, t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB>, where t<SUB>b</SUB> is the phase 
      arrival time from explosion B and t<SUB>a</SUB> is from explosion A. To 
      determine t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB>, we performed cross-correlations on 
      windows of the P- and N-wave arrivals in the frequency domain (Fremont and 
      Malone, 1987). The frequency domain technique can establish relative time 
      difference estimates that are below the limit imposed by the sampling 
      interval. This allows relative locations with a precision on the order of 
      several meters even with a system sample interval of 0.01 seconds/sample. 
      We also compute the coherency of the phase arrivals to determine the 
      frequency range over which the slope of the cross-spectrum phase is 
      analyzed.&nbsp;</P></TD>

      <P>The seismograms of both explosions were first windowed using 2 second 
      windows around each of the P- and N-wave arrivals and then cosine tapered. 
      Rough estimates of t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB> were then determined by 
      hand picking a common peak or trough of explosion A and B. The windowed 
      seismograms were then shifted by this t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB> before 
      computing the coherency and cross phase spectra. We find that the 
      coherency between phase arrivals falls-off at high frequencies, and 
      therefore we only used frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz. A line is fit to 
      the slope of the cross phase spectra in equation (1) by least squares, 
      with an intercept fixed at 0 Hz and an <I>n</I> equal to 0. We finally 
      correct the initial t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB> value by adding it with 
      <I>DELTA t</I> thus giving the precise time separation of the two phases. 
      The cross-coherence plots and phase spectra from PAH are shown in Figure 
      3, and the apparent time lags with uncertainties derived from these cross 
      spectra are given in Table 3.&nbsp; 
      <P>The results were not affected by different initial 
      t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB> but estimating it as close as possible to the 
      actual time shift helps to reduce the uncertainty due to phase unwrapping. 
      There is always a <I>2 pi n</I> uncertainty in unwrapping the phase 
      spectra but since an initial shift was performed, we expect <I>n</I> to be 
      0 or 1 and the maximum uncertainty in phase to be less than <I>2 pi</I>. 
      The fall-off in coherency at high frequencies is more likely due to the 
      first explosion superimposed upon the record of the second, or possible 
      differences in the details of the two source time functions rather than 
      being due to slight differences in the travel paths caused by the 
      difference in the source locations. The loss in coherency is reflected in 
      the large uncertainties in estimating the slope of phase of the cross 
      spectra.&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <H2>Discussion and Uncertainties</H2>The optimal relative location of the 
      second explosion, based on 3 pairs of stations, is within the 
      uncertainties of the CSB investigation. The difference in separation 
      between our estimate (73.2 meters) and the CSB estimate (76.2 meters) is 
      small compared to the source dimensions, and the difference in azimuth 
      between our estimate (145°) and the CSB estimate (147°) is also within the 
      range of angles that is allowed by the source sizes. There is no straight 
      forward way of computing an uncertainty for the optimal values of <I>L</I> 
      and <I>beta</I>, but since the three solution lines in Figure 4 do not 
      exactly intersect, the area created by the intersection illustrates an 
      approximate uncertainty.&nbsp; 
      <P>We compute uncertainties for individual station pairs by the standard 
      deviation, <I>sigma</I>, which is the square root of the variance between 
      the best fit slope of equation (1) to the phase of the cross spectra. 
      These standard deviations are converted to t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB> 
      uncertainties and listed in Table 3. We then propagate 
      t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB> uncertainties through equation (3) by 
      arbitrarily fixing $beta$ equal to 145°, and using <I>± 1 sigma</I> in 
      t<SUB>b</SUB>-t<SUB>a</SUB> to convert to the maximum uncertainty in the 
      source separation, <I>L</I>, for each station pair. The importance of 
      receiver geometry on uncertainty is shown by the difference in separation 
      uncertainties between different station pairs. Station pair PAH and WAK 
      has a path which is almost along strike of the explosions and has an 
      uncertainty of ± 17 meters. The station pair WCN and PAH has a path 
      relatively more perpendicular to the strike of the explosions and has a 
      larger uncertainty of ± 33 meters. The path which is more parallel to the 
      strike of the explosions has a better resolution of the 
      separation.&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>&nbsp;

    <TD align=left vAlign=top NOSAVE>There is no significant source of error 
      associated with timing in the recorder itself. The digital stations 
      maintain absolute timing by synchronizing with a GPS time signal that is 
      broadcast from the Seismological Laboratory. The GPS signal is broadcast 
      every second and a high precision oscillator in the seismograph unit is 
      phase-locked to UTC by this pulse. A radio frequency delay of 44 ms, which 
      occurs in the electronics and telemetry systems, is accounted for in 
      establishing absolute time of the recorded waveforms. A timing mismatch of 
      1 msec between the GPS time and the internal clock time results in a clock 
      correction that is reported by the instrument. Timing errors during 
      regular operation rarely exceed several msec. Because the two explosions 
      occurred within 3.52 sec, the absolute timing of the instrumentation can 
      affect the location that we gave for the first explosion, but not the 
      relative locations of the first and second explosion. Only the error in 
      the digitization rate is relevant to uncertainties in the relative 
      locations. The manufacturer reports that errors in the digitization rate 
      for the internal oscillator do not exceed 1 msec for any one sample and 
      are expected to be on the order of 50 microsec. If the oscillator would 
      drift more than 1 msec over any recording period, then a timing correction 
      would be initiated by the instrument and its results would be recorded in 
      the instrument log.&nbsp; 
      <P>Atmospheric conditions that affect the speed of sound can shift the 
      estimated separations slightly. We used an air velocity of 343 m/s 
      (Kinsler et al., 1982). For a 10% uncertainty in the assumed air velocity 
      of 343 m/s, which is greater than expected, the relative source separation 
      error would be ± 7.0 meters, which does not impact our conclusion as to 
      the relative source locations or the chronology. A constant wind velocity 
      across the array on the morning of the blasts would not be significant; a 
      10 MPH wind has only 1.3% of the speed of 
air.&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>&nbsp;

    <TD align=left vAlign=top NOSAVE>One of our objectives was to see if it is 
      feasible to measure the separation between the explosions using the P- or 
      S-wave waves. From Table 4, we see that the best estimate of the 
      separation using the P-waves is 80 m, which is consistent with the 
      estimates using the N-waves. However, the uncertainty in the time 
      separation for the P-waves from WCN and PAH leads to a large uncertainty 
      on the separation. The P-wave at WAK, 116 km epicentral distance, was too 
      weak to provide a reliable separation. These results confirm that 
      high-precision relative locations of closely spaced multiple events can be 
      resolved, given an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, and two or more

      <H2>Directivity and Source Dimension</H2>Figure 6 shows the uncorrected 
      spectra of the P- and N-waves from the two explosions at PAH. The spectra 
      of the three components were log averaged and then smoothed. The P-wave 
      spectra at PAH for explosion B is 3 to 4 times larger than explosion A, 
      which is consistent with the report that the site of explosion B contained 
      more explosives however, the amplitude ratio is twice the reported ratio 
      of explosive mass. In comparison, the N-wave spectral amplitudes for B are 
      similar to explosion A, which is inconsistent with the P-wave spectra. The 
      larger P-wave spectral ratio between explosions and a smaller N-wave 
      spectral ratio suggests that explosion B was more coupled to the ground, 
      thus allowing more energy to be partitioned into the ground than into the 
      air. We speculate that explosion B initiated at the top of the stockpile, 
      resulting in downward directivity, partitioning more energy into the 
      ground than into the air, and forming a crater 1.8 meters deep, while 
      explosion A had upwards directivity consistent with the absence of a 
      crater. The CSB hypothesized that the first explosion triggered the second 
      explosion when debris from the first explosion entered the building 
      through the ceiling or skylight at the second site. This mechanism is 
      consistent with the observed directivity. The S-wave from the first 
      explosion is predicted to arrive 4.2 seconds after the P-wave at PAH 
      (Figure 3). The S-wave may contaminate the P-wave spectra of the second 
      explosion, therefore making it higher in amplitude. This could suggest an 
      alternative scenario in which two explosions had the same yields, as 
      suggested by the similar N-wave spectral ratio. However the spectra for 
      the first 0.5 seconds still differ by a factor of 2, making this scenario 
      less likely.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>&nbsp;

    <TD NOSAVE>The physical dimensions of the explosions, like the dimensions 
      of earthquakes, should be related to the corner frequency, 
      <I>f<SUB>c</SUB></I>, measured from the Fourier spectrum. To test this 
      hypothesis, we used an equation for the earthquake source radius <I>r</I> 
      from Brune (1970):&nbsp; 
      <CENTER><IMG alt="Equation 5." 
      src="Layout example_files/equation4.gif">(5)&nbsp;</CENTER>
      <P>where <I>c</I> is either the P-wave velocity or the speed of sound in 
      air. The measured crater of the southern explosion was about 12 meters 
      across and 1.8 meters deep, suggesting that the expected source radius is 
      6 meters. The northern explosion did not leave a crater but the building 
      was formerly 40 feet by 40 feet, giving an upper limit to the source 
      radius of about 6 meters.&nbsp; 
      <P>The Fourier spectra from the N-waves, shown in Figure 6b, are 
      relatively flat from 1 Hz to above 30 Hz. The high frequencies of the 
      N-waves are limited by the anti-aliasing filters in the recorder (at 40 
      Hz). The spectrum from the northern explosion might suggest the presence 
      of a corner at about 30 Hz, which from equation (4) would give a source 
      radius of 4 meters. Such a result is reasonable considering the 
      independent information about the size of the building.&nbsp; 
      <P>The P-wave spectra fall off rapidly above 6 Hz, so we take 6 Hz to 
      represent the corner frequency of these spectra. In equation (4) we use 
      the P-wave velocity of 3000 m/sec from the topmost layer of the velocity 
      model in Table 1 which is reasonable for weathered bedrock. With this 
      combination of parameters, equation (4) gives <I>r</I> equal to 60 meters, 
      which is about factor of of ten larger than the estimate from the N-wave 
      and from ground observations. We therefore suggest that attenuation along 
      the path has played a major role in decreasing the amplitude of high 
      frequency P-waves. The P-waves spectra have decreased to amplitudes 
      comparable to the pre-event noise above 20 Hz, implying that the 
      attenuation eliminates the chance to use P-waves to estimate the source 
      dimension for small events, whether earthquakes or explosions. For 
      earthquakes, the P-waves would pass through the near surface zone of 
      severe attenuation only once, so resolution of a high corner frequency 
      should be somewhat better than in this 
case.&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>&nbsp;

      <H2>Conclusions</H2>We have analyzed the relative arrivals of both similar 
      looking P- and N-waves at a number of seismic stations to estimate the 
      spatial separation and orientation of two closely-spaced explosions. 
      Analysis of seismograms indicate that two explosions occurred separated in 
      time by 3.52 seconds. The best solution for the source separation and 
      azimuth is determined by the combination of N-waves from 3 station pairs. 
      We conclude that the initial explosion occurred at the northern site and 
      that the southern explosion occurred about 73.2 meters S35°E. Individual 
      estimates using only a pair of stations have relatively higher 
      uncertainties but still supports our conclusions. The separation and 
      orientation of the two explosions were consistent with, and well within 
      uncertainties of the data provided by the CSB. P-wave arrivals recorded 
      only for one source-receiver path yields a separation of 80 m with an 
      individual uncertainty of ± 340 meters.&nbsp; 
      <P>From the relative spectral amplitudes of P- and N-waves, we speculate 
      that explosion B may have had a downward directivity, whereas explosion A 
      may have been more upwardly directed. From the viewpoint of forensic 
      seismology, this experiment was successful, in that the N-waves 
      unambiguously demonstrate that the northern of the two explosions occurred 
      first. We confirm that the relative separation of sources can be 
      determined precisely using only a pair of regional seismic stations with 
      an optimal alignment.&nbsp;
