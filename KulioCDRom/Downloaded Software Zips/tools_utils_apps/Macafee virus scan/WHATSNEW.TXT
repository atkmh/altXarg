NEW FEATURES 

1.  The Dr Solomon's virus scanning engine is at the heart 
    of VirusScan 4.0.1. Backed by the world's largest
    antivirus research organization, it delivers
    outstanding virus detection and cleaning rates. The
    new engine also detects viruses in nearly all of the
    popular compressed file formats.

2.  A new Emergency Disk wizard now guides you through the
    process of formatting a floppy disk, copying necessary
    files to it, and preparing the disk for use. The
    Emergency Disk you create is now easier to use and more
    powerful than in previous VirusScan versions.

3.  A new VShield Properties dialog box groups the 
    configuration options for VShield's long-standing
    System Scan module with those for its new E-mail Scan,
    Internet Filter, and Download Scan modules. For even
    quicker and easier setup, VShield includes a
    configuration wizard that enables the most common
    scanning options for an excellent balance between
    system performance and virus protection. Now you can
    set up VShield in one quick pass and get complete
    protection from viruses and malicious software at all
    potential points of entry.

4.  VShield's E-mail Scan module looks for viruses in
    e-mail attachments you receive via your in-house
    corporate e-mail system. VShield's Download Scan
    module, meanwhile, checks e-mail you receive via
    popular Internet mail applications.
    
5.  Download Scan also examines other files you choose to
    download, while the Internet Filter module detects
    hostile Java applets and ActiveX controls. You can also
    configure Internet Filter to block access to specific
    undesirable sites. With this broad focus, VirusScan
    seals all points of entry for viruses and other
    malicious software.

6.  New versions of VirusScan Command Line components give
    VirusScan for Windows 95 and Windows 98 powerful and
    up-to-date protection for command-line environments.

7.  Specialized scanners help to protect your MAPI-based
    and cc:Mail corporate e-mail systems against virus
    threats. Use VShield to scan your corporate e-mail
    systems in the background, in a continuous sweep for
    viruses that infect your e-mail. Supplement VShield's
    E-mail Scan protection with VirusScan's new on-demand
    E-mail Scan component, which lets you initiate a scan
    operation on MAPI-compliant Microsoft Exchange or
    Outlook mailboxes.

8.  VirusScan's heuristic scanning technology evaluates the
    probability that a file or a macro might be infected by
    a new, unidentified virus. You can choose to use
    heuristic scanning to look for file-infecting viruses,
    macro viruses, or both.

9.  A revamped VShield Security module allows you to protect
    individual property pages for any VShield module against
    unauthorized changes. Use it to keep others who use your
    computer from making changes, or configure VShield with
    those settings you want all users on your network to
    have, then distribute password-protected settings files
    to enforce a network-wide anti-virus security policy.

10. A rewritten VirusScan Scheduler replaces the AV Console
    component included with previous VirusScan versions. It
    now includes right-click functionality that allows you
    to create new tasks and view activity logs directly
    from the task list. An enhanced scheduling function
    allows you to run your tasks at a random interval within
    60 minutes of the time you set for them. This feature
    allows you to avoid clogging network bandwidth with
    simultaneous update or upgrade requests, or cross-
    network scanning tasks.

11. VirusScan detects and cleans files infected with the
    Win95/CIH and Win95/Marburg viruses. These viruses
    infect Windows 95 and Windows 98 portable executable
    (PE) files. A portable executable file is a Windows
    resource file that other executable files can share
    --examples include dynamic linking library (.DLL)
    files.

12. The new scanning engine also includes improved
    detection and cleaning capability for the W97M/Class,
    W97M/Groov, and XM/COMPAT.A viruses, along with a
    new strain of the XF/PAIX virus.


* NEW VIRUSES DETECTED *

              **** IMPORTANT NOTE ****

This release of VirusScan for Windows 95 and Windows 98
functions ONLY with the 40xx .DAT file series, beginning
with the 4001 .DAT file included with this program package.
You CANNOT use VirusScan for Windows 95 and Windows 98
with earlier .DAT file versions, nor may you use the .DAT
files included in this release with 2.x or 3.x versions
of VirusScan for Windows 95 and Windows 98.

                         ****

Because the previous VirusScan scanning engine and the
newly incorporated Dr Solomon scanning engine identify
and classify viruses in different ways, this release of
VirusScan for Windows 95 and Windows 98 does not include a
list of viruses detected or cleaned. Future releases will
incorporate this information, once McAfee Labs adopts a
standard virus naming convention.

The INTERNET.DAT component of the .DAT files included with
this release enables VirusScan to detect these 130 hostile

KNOWN ISSUES

1.  Using DOS memory managers might cause VirusScan to
    falsely detect viruses in memory. Since Windows 95 and
    Windows 98 no longer require DOS memory managers, you
    can eliminate false warnings by preceding each line in
    your CONFIG.SYS file that includes settings for a DOS
    memory manager with REM. This deactivates the memory
    manager. To learn more about working with your
    CONFIG.SYS file, see your DOS or Windows documentation.

2.  If you use a password to protect your VShield
    configuration options, VShield will ask you for that
    password whenever you open the VShield Properties
    dialog box. Use your mouse to click inside the text
    box provided in order to enter the password--keyboard
    shortcuts will not work. Microsoft acknowledges this
    issue in its Knowledge Base Article ID #Q84133. Next,
    click OK to use the password you enter. To close the
    password verification dialog box without entering a
    password, click Cancel.

3.  Disk defragmentation programs move files as they work
    to maximize hard disk efficiency. If you have VShield,
    VirusScan, or other applications active during a disk
    defragmentation operation, your disk defragmentation
    program might tell you that it cannot find the active
    application files. This is normal and does not mean
    that the files do not exist. To avoid error messages
    like this, close all open applications and disable
    VShield, then run your disk defragmentation operation
    again. 

4.  If you unzip a virus-infected file into a directory
    on a Novell server that you've specified with Universal
    Naming Convention (UNC) notation, VShield does not
    detect the infection as the file gets created on the
    server directory. If you use Windows Explorer to map
    the server directory to your computer, however,
    VShield will detect the virus as it gets created. To
    ensure maximum anti-virus protection for your NetWare
    servers, install and use NetShield NetWare from
    Network Associates.

5.  If you ask VShield to prompt you for an action when
    it finds a virus or a hostile object and you choose
    to have VShield move the infected file to a quarantine
    directory, VShield does not retain the correct
    filename for the infected file. Instead, VShield
    renames the infected file as it moves it. As a result,
    the infected file appears on the hard disk with a
    completely different filename and a .TMP extension.

    If you tell VShield to move infected files to a
    quarantine directory automatically, however, the
    program will retain the correct file names.

6.  If VShield detects a virus in a file that you try to
    open from within another application, by default it
    will prompt you with a range of possible responses.
    If you then choose to clean the infected file, the
    application will tell you that it cannot open the
    file you just cleaned.

    To work around this limitation, click OK to close the
    error message, then try to open the file again. The
    application should open the file successfully on the
    second try.

    This issue does not occur if you have set VShield to
    prompt you for a response when it finds a virus, but
    have also selected Continue Access as one of the
    possible responses. Rather than a dialog box with
    buttons, VShield displays a full-screen alert that
    lists your response options.

    To learn more about configuring VShield's response
    options, see "Using VShield" in the VirusScan
    User's Guide.

7.  If you start your computer with a VirusScan Emergency
    Disk that you created, the Emergency Disk utility will
    quit to a command prompt when it detects and cleans a
    boot sector infection. To ensure that you have removed
    all infecting viruses from your system, Network
    Associates recommends that you use the Emergency Disk
    to restart your computer again, then run another scan
    operation, before you restart your computer normally.

10. If you have VShield's E-Mail Scan module enabled,
    VShield logs on to your MAPI mail server in order to
    scan your mailbox for viruses. Ordinarily, VShield
    logs on with your default MAPI profile soon after you
    start your computer. But if you start your computer
    and wait a while before logging on to your network
    domain controller, VShield will prompt you to log on
    to your MAPI mail server even if you have not yet
    logged on to your network, and even if your MAPI
    server is not in the domain you usually log in to.

INSTALLATION         

* INSTALLING VIRUSSCAN *

1.  Insert the floppy disk or compact disc with your copy
    of VirusScan into your floppy disk drive or CD-ROM
    drive.

    If you downloaded a compressed copy of VirusScan
    from the Network Associates website or other electronic
    service, create a temporary directory on your hard disk
    or on a disk available on your network, then extract
    the files you downloaded into that directory.

2.  Click Start in the Windows taskbar, then choose Run.

3.  Type x:\setup.exe in the Run dialog box to start the
    installation utility from a floppy disk. To start the
    utility from a CD-ROM, type x:\win95\setup.exe. In both
    cases, x is the drive letter that designates your
    floppy drive or your CD-ROM drive.

    If you extracted files that you downloaded to your
    hard disk or to a disk on your network, specify the
    path to the correct directory. For example, type
    C:\DOWNLOAD\SETUP.EXE.

4.  Click OK to continue.

    The VirusScan installation wizard will start. Follow
    the instructions shown on each wizard pane to choose
    the VirusScan options you want.

5.  When you finish your installation, restart your
    computer.

* TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION *

The Eicar Standard AntiVirus Test File is a combined
effort by anti-virus vendors throughout the world to
implement one standard by which customers can verify
their anti-virus installations.

To test your installation, copy the following line
into its own file, then save the file with the name
EICAR.COM.

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

The file size will be 69 or 70 bytes.

Next, start VirusScan and allow it to scan the
directory that contains EICAR.COM. When VirusScan
scans this file, it will report finding the
EICAR-STANDARD-AV-TEST-FILE virus.

Note that this file is NOT A VIRUS. Delete the file
when you have finished testing your installation to
avoid alarming unsuspecting users.

______________________
UNINSTALLING VIRUSSCAN

To uninstall VirusScan, click Start in the Windows taskbar,
choose Settings, point to Control Panel, and open. Open the
Add/Remove Programs utility from the folder. Highlight
VirusScan on the program list, and click Add/Remove to
uninstall VirusScan.

To remove VirusScan without using the uninstall utility,
follow these steps: 

1.  Remove references to VirusScan from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
    and your SYSTEM.INI files. To do so, follow these
    steps:

    A.  Start the Windows system editor. Click Start in the
        Windows taskbar, then choose Run. Type SYSEDIT in
        the Run dialog box, then click OK.
    
        A set of text files will open on your screen. Your
        AUTOEXEC.BAT file should appear as the first or
        topmost window in this set. Click the title bar for
        the SYSTEM.INI window to bring it to the foreground,
        then locate this line:

        [boot]SCRNSAVE.EXE=C:\PROGRA~1\NETWOR~1\MCAFEE~1\SCRSCAN.EXE

    B.  Change the line to read:

        [boot]SCRNSAVE.EXE=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WINDOW~1.SCR    

    D.  When you have restored your SYSTEM.INI file to its
        original state, choose Save from the SYSEDIT File
        menu to save your changes, then choose Exit from the
        File menu to quit the SYSEDIT application.

2.  Remove VirusScan icons from the Start menu. To do this,
    follow these steps:

    A.  Click Start in the Windows taskbar, point to
        Settings, then choose Taskbar.

Regularly updated lists of frequently asked questions 
about Network Associates products also are available on
the Network Associates website, and on CompuServe
and America Online.

Q:  I use both cc:Mail and a MAPI-compliant e-mail system
    at work. Can I have VShield scan both of these systems
    at once or switch back and forth between them?

A:  VShield includes log-in support for only one e-mail
    system at a time. You may not, for example, have
    VShield log in to scan your Microsoft Mail or
    MAPI-compliant mail server for viruses, then switch it
    to scan a Lotus cc:Mail server. You must first allow
    VShield to finish logging on to one type of mail server
    --either the MAPI server or the cc:Mail server--before
    you tell it to log on to the other type of server.


Q:  When I try to restart my computer in MS-DOS mode,
    Windows shows me an error message that reads "Windows
    cannot restart the computer, or start MS-DOS mode with
    messaging service running." The only change I made to
    the computer was installing VirusScan and enabling
    VShield's E-mail Scan module. What happened?

A:  Windows cannot restart your computer in MS-DOS mode if
    you have VShield running in the background. To unload
    VShield from memory, right-click the VShield icon in 
    the Windows system tray, then choose Exit from the
    shortcut menu that appears. 


Q:  I've tried to get VShield's E-Mail Scan module to scan
    my Microsoft Outlook mailbox for viruses, but it doesn't
    seem to be scanning my mailbox at all. What's happening?

A:  In order for VShield's E-Mail Scan module to look for
    viruses in your mailbox on a MAPI e-mail server, it
    must log on to your mail system. VShield does so by
    using your default MAPI profile, which consists of a
    group of settings keyed to a particular user name and
    password. If you have logged on to the server with a
    profile other than your default profile, VShield will
    not be able to scan your mailbox, because it will not
    be able to get access to it via your default profile.
    If you have not logged on to the server at all, VShield
    will ask you for your user name and password so that
    it can log on to the server on your behalf.

    To see what you have as your default MAPI profile:

    1. Click Start in the Windows taskbar, point to
       Settings, then choose Control Panel to open the
       Control Panel window.

    2. Locate and double-click the Mail icon in the Control
       Panel window.

       This opens a Properties dialog box with your name
       or the name of the person currently logged in to
       your computer.

    3. Click Show Profiles to open another dialog box
       that lists all of the profiles you have enabled
       on this computer. At the bottom of the dialog box,
       you can choose which profile you want to use to
       log on to your mail system initially.

    4. Make any changes you want to make, then click
       Close to close the control panel.

    NOTE: Because MAPI initializes only once during a
    Windows session, logging on to a MAPI server means
    that you will remain logged on until you restart your
    computer. Therefore, if you close your e-mail client
    and reopen it, or disable the E-Mail Scan module then
    reactivate it, the MAPI server will NOT prompt you for
    a user name and password.


Q:  I am installing new software on my computer, and the
    manual recommends disabling any anti-virus software.
    How do I disable VShield without uninstalling it?

A:  Right-click the VShield icon located in your system
    tray next to the system clock, point to Enable, then
    choose System Scan from the shortcut menu. If System
    Scan does not have a checkmark beside it in this menu,
    it is already disabled. After you install your new
    software, reactivate VShield by right-clicking the
    VShield icon in the system tray, pointing to Enable,
    then choosing System Scan from the shortcut menu. If
    System Scan has a checkmark next to it in the menu,
    it is enabled. 


Q:  How can I configure VShield so that network users can
    enable or disable VShield options temporarily, but keep
    them from saving these changes permanently?

A:  First set the options you want in the VShield Properties
    dialog box, then click OK to save your changes. Next,
    open Windows Explorer and locate the DEFAULT.VSH file
    in the VirusScan program directory. Right-click the
    file, then choose Properties from the shortcut menu
    that appears. In the Properties dialog box, select the
    Read-only checkbox in the Attributes area. Your users
    can then enable or disable any VShield options they
    want to, but their copy of VShield will not save those
    changes to the DEFAULT.VSH file.

Q:  I've activated VirusScan's heuristic scanning option,
    but it won't identify the viruses it detects. Why not?

A:  VirusScan's heuristic scanning feature looks for certain
    "virus-like" characteristics in the files it scans. When
    it finds a sufficient number of these characteristics,
    VirusScan concludes that the file is infected. This
    powerful scanning technique allows VirusScan to discover
    viruses that are so new that they do not yet have names
    or identities. VirusScan will, however, identify viruses
    by name when they match its list of known viruses. 


Q:  When I choose Virus List in VirusScan, I get a message
    that tells me it's unable to connect. What's happening?

A:  Network Associates now stores its virus information in
    a web-based Virus Information Library. To use this
    feature, you must have a network-based or dial-up
    Internet connection and web browsing software installed
    on your computer. If you still cannot connect, start
    your web browser and enter this address into the text
    box at the top of your browser window:
  
    http://www.nai.com/vinfo


Q:  I opened VirusScan Scheduler, then I configured,
    activated and scheduled a scan task to run, but it
    never did. What happened?

A:  To run a scheduled scan task, you must leave VirusScan
    Scheduler running. If you close the Scheduler or shut
    down your computer, the scheduled task will not run. If
    the task misses the time it's supposed to run, it will
    not run when you next start your computer or when you
    next start the Scheduler, it will wait until the next
    scheduled time you have set for it to run.


Q:  I have an existing VirusScan installation with a lot
    of custom settings. Can I keep these settings when I
    upgrade to the current VirusScan version?

A:  The Setup utility for VirusScan v4.0.1 or later will
    offer to preserve your settings from previous versions
    during installation. This feature will preserve any
    configuration options you set in v3.2.0 or later. It
    will make every attempt to preserve settings for
    VirusScan 3.x versions earlier than v3.2.0, but
    Network Associates does not support this feature for
    versions earlier than v3.2.0. Setup will NOT preserve
    settings from VirusScan v2.x, nor from any version of
    WebScanX.


Q:  When VirusScan detects an infection in files compressed
    in .CAB or ZIP-SFX format, why doesn't VirusScan clean,
    delete, or move the files?

A:  Because files compressed in .CAB and ZIP-SFX formats can
    include a Microsoft Authenticode certificate, altering
    the files can render them unusable. To avoid this
    possibility, VirusScan does not clean, delete, or move
    infected files compressed in .CAB or ZIP-SFX format.
    Network Associates recommends that you decompress any
    infected files compressed in these formats, then run
    VirusScan again to clean the uncompressed files.


Q:  When my screen saver starts, I suddenly see a lot 
    of activity on my hard disk. What's happening? How do
    I stop this activity?

A:  VirusScan includes a component called ScreenScan that
    scans for viruses on your hard disk during periods 
    when your computer is idle. In order to use ScreenScan,
    you must install it separately as part of a custom
    installation. Then, during idle periods, ScreenScan
    starts the screen saver you chose in your Windows
    preferences property page and begins scanning for
    viruses.
 
    You can disable ScreenScan by following these steps:

    1.  Move your cursor to the Windows 95/98 desktop, then
        click your right mouse button.

    2.  Choose Properties from the shortcut menu that 
        appears.

    3.  Click the ScreenScan tab in the Display Properties
        dialog box.

    4.  Clear the Enable Scanning While in Screen Saver Mode
        check box.

    5.  Click OK to close the Display Properties dialog box.


Q:  VirusScan detected a virus on my system, but it is not
    one of the default files listed in its Program
    Extensions dialog box. Therefore, I suspect it might be
    a false detection. What can I do to verify a detected
    virus?

A:  If you suspect a false detection on a non-executable 
    file, run VirusScan's command line scanner, SCAN.EXE, 
    to verify the infection. If VirusScan detects a virus
    and SCAN.EXE does not, download the latest .DAT files
    to update your virus definition files, then scan your
    system again. If VirusScan still detects a virus that
    you suspect is a false detection, please report the
    issue to Network Associates technical support.


Q:  I would like to purchase and download the latest
    version of VirusScan from one of the Network Associates
    electronic services, but I do not want to give my 
    credit card information over the Internet for
    security purposes. Can I purchase VirusScan via modem
    and download the product via the Internet?

A:  Yes. The first time you download VirusScan, the Network
    Associates SecureCast wizard will prompt you to select
    the transmission method you prefer to use to download
    your Network Associates product. It will also prompt
    you to transmit your encrypted credit card information.

    At the Transaction Connection Type dialog box, select
    Internet to download your order via the Internet.
    At the Security Connection Type dialog box, select
    Direct Dial Modem to transmit your credit card
    information via modem.


Q:  I have created my own Emergency diskette without using
    the Emergency Disk creation utility. Is there anything
    I need to do to be sure that it will work properly?

A:  To enable your own Emergency Disk, you must create a
    CONFIG.SYS file on the boot diskette, then add these
    lines:

       DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS
       DOS=HIGH
    
    Add the HIMEM.SYS file from the DOS directory or, if you
    are using Windows 95 or Windows 98 system files, add 
    HIMEM.SYS from the \WINDOWS directory to the
    boot diskette.

    Note: For detailed instructions on creating an Emergency
    Disk, refer to the instructions outlined in VirusScan
    User's Guide, which you'll find on the Network
    Associates website.


Q:  I moved a .VSC file to my Startup folder. Whenever I
    turn on my computer, VirusScan starts, but does not
    begin scanning. How can I make VirusScan start scanning
    automatically?

A:  You need to customize your options. Follow these
    steps:

    1.  Location the .VSC file you saved.

    2.  Right-click the .VSC file, then choose Properties
        from the shortcut menu that appears.
  
    3.  Click the Detection tab.
 
    5.  Select the Start Automatically check box.

    6.  Click OK to close the properties dialog box.


Q:  When VirusScan starts, how does it determine its
    default settings?

A:  VirusScan reads its default settings from the
    DEFAULT.VSC file located in the installation directory.


Q:  What error codes can CHKVXD.EXE return?

A:  Possible CHKVXD.EXE error level codes, along with their
    descriptions, are:

    65535(-1)= VShield not installed

    0 = VShield enabled

    1 = VShield disabled 


Q:  How can I tell that ScreenScan is working?

A:  ScreenScan does not tell you when it scans your system,
    but if you enable the logging option when you configure
    it, VirusScan will record all ScreenScan activity in
    its log file. 

    
Q:  Can I update Network Associates data (.DAT) files to
    detect new viruses?

A:  Yes, you can install and use the Network Associates
    SecureCast client software to receive updated files
    automatically, as soon as they become available. For
    details, consult the VirusScan User's Guide.
    
    If you need additional assistance with downloading, 
    contact Network Associates Download Support. Contact
    information appears later in this file.


Q:  An error occurs when VirusScan has completed 95 percent
    of its installation. Why does this occur on my system,
    but not on others?

A:  Using a non-standard Windows 95 Winsock will cause the
    Setup to fail on some systems at the 95 percent
    completed point. To prevent this, use the default
    Windows 95 Winsock.


Q:  I removed the Recycle Bin from the VirusScan exclusions
    list. How can I replace it?

A:  Because the Recycle Bin is a system folder, it cannot
    be added to the exclusions list using VirusScan's
    browse feature. To restore it to the list, enter the
    Recycle Bin's full path in the exclusions list:

    \Recycled\


Q:  Why are additional extensions added to the Program Files
    Only list?

A:  As the Network Associates Anti-Virus Emergency Response
    Team finds viruses that can infect new file types, it
    adds new extensions to the default extensions list to
    enhance security. For instance, new viruses can infect
    Microsoft Office binder files, so the default extensions
    list now includes the file extension for these binder
    files so that VirusScan will examine them for viruses.


Q:  I thought I could right-click Microsoft Office .DO?,
    .XL?, or .OBD files, then choose Scan for Viruses
    from a shortcut menu in order to start a scan operation.
    I have Microsoft Office installed, but when I try this,
    it doesn't work. Why not?

A:  If you installed Microsoft Office after you installed
    VirusScan, you might need to reinstall VirusScan to
    enable context-sensitive shortcut menus.


Q:  I am having trouble installing Service Pack 2 for
    Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0. Why?

A:  VShield uses files which the upgrade needs to write to.
    In order to successfully install the service pack,
    you must first close VShield by right-clicking the
    VShield icon the Windows system tray, then selecting
    Exit. You will now be able to successfully run the
    service pack upgrade.


Q:  I'm running Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0, and
    VirusScan's On-Demand scan icons aren't showing on my
    taskbar. Why?

A:  If you're using Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0, the two
    Exchange On-Demand scan icons will not appear on the
    Windows taskbar. This is due to a limitation of
    Exchange. Please refer to your Exchange documentation
    for instructions on how to place these icons onto the
    taskbar within Exchange.
