        Introduction                                                        1

        This manual describes how to use the Visual Compare program to
        compare two program source files.  This manual and the Visual Compare
        program were written for programmers.

        Using Visual Compare's visual mode you can easily see the differences
        between two program source files and you can also selectively discard
        differences in order to quickly undo some of the changes that were
        made.

        Visual Compare requires an IBM Personal Computer or 100% compatible
        running DOS version 2.1 or later.

        Visual Compare uses a comparison algorithm that has been
        mathematically proven to always produce a shortest possible sequence
        of insertions and deletions that will convert file one to file two.


        Starting Visual Compare                                             2
        _____________________________________________________________________


        There are two ways to control the start of Visual Compare:

        1. Through arguments specified on the Visual Compare command line.

        2. Through commands specified in the Visual Compare initialization
           file.


        Visual Compare Command Line

        Run Visual Compare with no arguments to see a list of the available
        command line arguments or to have Visual Compare prompt for
        arguments.

        The form of the Visual Compare command line is as follows:

             VCOMP fileone filetwo [options]


        VCOMP

        The name of the program module.


        fileone

        The first of two files you wish to compare.


        filetwo

        The second of two files you wish to compare.


        If fileone or filetwo ends with a backslash (\) or colon (:) symbol,
        the filename (file name and optional extension) from the other
        fileone or filetwo command line argument is appended.  This can be
        convenient if file one and file two are in different subdirectories
        and have the same filename.  For example:

             VCOMP \OLD\ \NEW\SUPER.C

        is equivalent to

             VCOMP \OLD\SUPER.C \NEW\SUPER.C

        _____________________________________________________________________


        If fileone or filetwo has a file name consisting of an asterisk (*)
        symbol, the file name from the other fileone or filetwo command line
        argument is substituted.  For example:

             VCOMP *.BAK SUPER.C

        is equivalent to

             VCOMP SUPER.BAK SUPER.C


        options

        The following options may be specified with a leading / or -,
        whichever you prefer:

        /B

        Same as the BLACKANDWHITE initialization file command.

        Use /B to tell Visual Compare that you have a monochrome display
        attached to your computer.

        Visual Compare can usually determine whether you have a color or
        monochrome display.  If you have a color display, Visual Compare
        takes advantage of this and uses colors on the screen.

        However, if you have a CGA (Color Graphics Adapter), Visual Compare
        can't tell whether you have a monochrome or color display.  Since
        Visual Compare will assume you have a color display, you may wish to
        use /B to tell Visual Compare otherwise.


        /Tn

        2-64
        Default value: 8

        Same as the TABWIDTH initialization file command.

        Specifies the tab width to be used when expanding tabs, compressing
        spaces, or shifting the display right and left with the Tab and
        Shift-Tab keys.


        /25

        Displays 25 lines in visual mode.

        _____________________________________________________________________


        /43

        Displays 43 lines in visual mode if you have an EGA (Enhanced
        Graphics Adapter).


        /50

        Displays 50 lines in visual mode if you have a VGA (Video Graphics
        Array).


        /S[-]

        Writes an edit script to standard output that will consist of a
        shortest possible sequence of insertions and deletions that will
        convert file one to file two.

        Specify /S- to write the edit script in reverse order (from the end
        of file to the beginning of file).  This can be useful if you are
        using an editor to convert file one to file two using the edit
        script, since modifying the end of file one will not effect the line
        numbers in the edit script that refer to earlier lines in file one.


        /C

        Writes a composite file to standard output that is the same as the
        composite file displayed in visual mode except that strings are used
        to delimit text unique to file one or file two instead of colors.

        Use the ONESTART, ONEEND, TWOSTART, and TWOEND initialization file
        commands to specify the strings used to delimit text unique to file
        one or file two.  By default, ONESTART equals "$$$$$  fileone START
        $$$$$", ONEEND equals "$$$$$  fileone END  $$$$$", TWOSTART equals
        "$$$$$  filetwo START  $$$$$", and TWOEND equals "$$$$$  filetwo END
        $$$$$."  Where "fileone" and "filetwo" represent the fileone and
        filetwo command line arguments.

        One reason you might use this option is to run Visual Compare from
        within your editor in order to display output similar to that
        displayed in visual mode, in an editor window while you edit file two
        or file one in another editor window.

        _____________________________________________________________________


        /D

        Writes a file to standard output that consists of information about
        each difference.  The information consists of the corresponding file
        positions for file one and file two, whether the difference is an
        insertion or deletion, and the number of lines inserted or deleted.

        You might use this option to interface a program of your own design
        to Visual Compare.


        /En

        0-32736
        Default value: 32736

        The edit distance is defined as the length of a shortest possible
        sequence of insertions and deletions that will convert file one to
        file two.

        Use /En to set the maximum edit distance.  If you specify a value
        greater than 32736, Visual Compare will use 32736.  If while
        comparing files the maximum edit distance is exceeded, Visual Compare
        will display an appropriate message and abort.

        Use this option if you are comparing files that may be too different
        for the comparison to be useful and you don't want to wait for Visual
        Compare to complete the comparison if the comparison won't be useful.


        /I

        Same as the IGNORE initialization file command.

        Ignores leading space and tab characters when comparing lines.  Use
        /I if you are not interested in changes in the indentation of lines.


        /K

        Same as the CASE initialization file command.

        Considers upper-case and lower-case letters equivalent when comparing
        lines.


        Starting Visual Compare                                             6
        _____________________________________________________________________


        /Z

        Visual Compare was designed to perform a line-oriented comparison on
        two program source files.  It is possible for Visual Compare to
        compare two files that are not the same at the byte level and report
        that they are identical.  This can happen for six reasons.  First,
        the lines in the files are not all delimited in the same manner.  For
        example, lines in one file are delimited by Cr and lines in the other
        file by Cr-Lf.  Second, end-of-file characters (Ctrl-Z) can cause
        this to happen, because end-of-file characters are normally discarded
        and files are not normally read past the first end-of-file character.
        Third, tab characters can cause this to happen, because tab
        characters are normally expanded to spaces before the comparison
        takes place.  Fourth, trailing space and tab characters at the end of
        lines can cause this to happen, because, by default, trailing space
        and tab characters at the end of lines are discarded before the
        comparison takes place.  (To change the default, see the TRAILING
        initialization file command.)  Fifth, the /I command line option or
        the IGNORE initialization file command can cause this to happen,
        because they tell Visual Compare to ignore leading space and tab
        characters when comparing lines.  Sixth, the /K command line option
        or the CASE initialization file command can cause this to happen,
        because they tell Visual Compare to consider upper-case and
        lower-case letters equivalent when comparing lines.

        Use /Z to determine if two files are identical at the byte level.
        This option tells Visual Compare to not discard line delimiters, to
        not discard end-of-file characters and to read any characters past
        end-of-file characters, to not expand tab characters, to not discard
        trailing space and tab characters at the end of lines, to ignore the
        /I command line option or the IGNORE initialization file command, and
        to ignore the /K command line option or the CASE initialization file
        command.  Visual Compare will still perform a line-oriented
        comparison.  Visual Compare will also ignore the /C, /S, and /D
        command line options and will enter visual mode if the files are not
        identical.


        Visual Compare Initialization File

        Visual Compare automatically processes an initialization file called
        VCOMP.INI at the start of execution.

        Visual Compare first looks for VCOMP.INI in the current working
        directory.  If it doesn't find VCOMP.INI, it next looks in the
        directories specified by the PATH environment variable.

        _____________________________________________________________________


        The initialization file commands can be abbreviated.  For example,
        the TABSOUT command can be entered as TABS, TABSO, TABSOU, or
        TABSOUT.  The shortest legal abbreviation for a command is indicated
        by showing that portion of the command in uppercase and the rest of
        the command in lowercase.

        Some of the initialization file commands have command line option
        counterparts.  If both the initialization file command and the
        corresponding command line option are specified, the command line
        option will override.

        The available initialization file commands are as follows:

        Attributes

        Use ATTRIBUTES to control the colors Visual Compare uses on the
        screen.

        An attribute value is associated with each type of field that Visual
        Compare displays.  The following table lists the seven different
        field types displayed by Visual Compare.  Use ATTRIBUTES to specify
        an attribute value for each field type, in the order of the table
        below.

        Field                Description
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Common               lines common to file one and file two
        Delete               lines deleted from file one
        Insert               lines inserted from file two
        Function             function key and file name lines
        Window               help and prompt windows
        Error                error message windows
        Key                  keys in help and prompt windows

        Attribute values are numbers ranging from 0 to 255.  Different
        attribute values cause text to appear in different colors,
        highlighted, blinking, etc.  On most display adapters that handle
        color, you can use the following table to determine the attribute
        value corresponding to a given color.  Add the number corresponding
        to the desired foreground color to the number corresponding to the
        desired background color.  To also get blinking, add 128.

        12 light red
        13 light magenta
        14 yellow
        15 bright white

        On a MDA (Monochrome Display Adapter), the available attribute values
        are 7 for normal text, 15 for highlighted text, 65 for underlined
        text, and 112 for reverse video text.  To also get blinking, add 128
        to any of these values.

        Examples:

             ATTRIBUTES 27 28 26 30 63 79 15

        The default attribute values used by Visual Compare on a CGA (Color
        Graphics Adapter), an EGA (Enhanced Graphics Adapter), or a VGA
        (Video Graphics Array).

             ATTRIBUTES 7 112 15 7 112 112 15

        The default attribute values used by Visual Compare on a MDA
        (Monochrome Display Adapter).

        _____________________________________________________________________


        Blackandwhite

        Same as the /B command line option.

        Use BLACKANDWHITE to tell Visual Compare that you have a monochrome
        display attached to your computer.

        Visual Compare can usually determine whether you have a color or
        monochrome display.  If you have a color display, Visual Compare
        takes advantage of this and uses colors on the screen.

        However, if you have a CGA (Color Graphics Adapter), Visual Compare
        can't tell whether you have a monochrome or color display.  Since
        Visual Compare will assume you have a color display, you may wish to
        use BLACKANDWHITE to tell Visual Compare otherwise.


        Case

        Same as the /K command line option.

        Use CASE to tell Visual Compare to consider upper-case and lower-case
        letters equivalent when comparing lines.


        ENdofline

        CRLF, CR, or LF
        Default value: CRLF

        Use ENDOFLINE to tell Visual Compare the line delimiter to use when
        the composite file is written to disk by the F2 write function.  If
        Visual Compare is started with the /Z command line option, it will
        not discard the line delimiters in file one and file two and will
        write them to the composite file, instead of using the line delimiter
        specified by ENDOFLINE.

        _____________________________________________________________________


        EXPanded

        YES or NO

        Visual Compare keeps the contents of the files you are comparing in
        memory.  Visual Compare can use up to four megabytes of DOS and EMS
        (Lotus-Intel-Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification, version 3.0 or
        later) memory or DOS and XMS (eXtended Memory Specification) memory
        to store your files.  If Visual Compare detects that EMS memory is
        present in your system, it will automatically use it.  If EMS memory
        is not detected and XMS memory is detected, Visual Compare will
        automatically use XMS memory.

        Use EXPANDED NO to tell Visual Compare to ignore any EMS memory in
        your system, and to use only DOS and possibly XMS memory.  You may
        need to use EXPANDED NO if your EMS driver is not compatible with
        Visual Compare.  You may also want to use EXPANDED NO for performance
        reasons.


        EXTended

        YES or NO

        Visual Compare keeps the contents of the files you are comparing in
        memory.  Visual Compare can use up to four megabytes of DOS and EMS
        (Lotus-Intel-Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification, version 3.0 or
        later) memory or DOS and XMS (eXtended Memory Specification) memory
        to store your files.  If Visual Compare detects that EMS memory is
        present in your system, it will automatically use it.  If EMS memory
        is not detected and XMS memory is detected, Visual Compare will
        automatically use XMS memory.

        Use EXTENDED NO to tell Visual Compare to ignore any XMS memory in
        your system, and to use only DOS and possibly EMS memory.  You may
        need to use EXTENDED NO if your XMS driver is not compatible with
        Visual Compare.  You may also want to use EXTENDED NO for performance
        reasons.


        Height

        25, 43, or 50

        Use HEIGHT to tell Visual Compare how many lines to display in visual
        mode.  You must have either an EGA (Enhanced Graphics Adapter) or a
        VGA (Video Graphics Array) for this command to have any effect.

        _____________________________________________________________________


        Ignore

        Same as the /I command line option.

        If you are not interested in changes in the indentation of lines, use
        IGNORE to tell Visual Compare to ignore leading space and tab
        characters when comparing lines.


        SHadow

        YES or NO

        Use SHADOW to tell Visual Compare whether or not windows should have
        shadows.


        SNowcontrol

        YES or NO

        The IBM Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) requires special programming to
        prevent "snow" from appearing on the screen when a program changes
        the contents of the screen.  The special programming slows down
        screen updating and is not necessary for most other display adapters.
        If Visual Compare detects a MDA (Monochrome Display Adapter), an EGA
        (Enhanced Graphics Adapter), or a VGA (Video Graphics Array), it does
        not "desnow."  If Visual Compare detects a CGA, it will try to
        determine whether "desnowing" is necessary.

        If you suspect that Visual Compare is "desnowing" when it is not
        necessary, you may want to use SNOWCONTROL NO which will allow Visual
        Compare to run faster.

        If your computer "locks up" when you run Visual Compare, use
        SNOWCONTROL NO.

        If Visual Compare incorrectly determines that your CGA does not
        require "desnowing", you can force Visual Compare to "desnow" by
        using SNOWCONTROL YES.

        _____________________________________________________________________


        TABSout

        Use TABSOUT to tell Visual Compare to compress spaces in the
        composite file to tab characters (using the default tab width of 8 or
        the tab width specified by the TABWIDTH initialization file command
        or the /Tn command line option) before writing the composite file to
        disk.  Spaces appearing after the first single or double quote on a
        line are not compressed and single spaces are not changed to tab
        characters.

        TABSOUT effects the composite file written to disk by the visual mode
        F2 write function and has no effect on the composite file written to
        standard output by the /C command line option.


        TABWidth

        2-64
        Default value: 8

        Same as the /Tn command line option.

        Specifies the tab width to be used when expanding tabs, compressing
        spaces, or shifting the display right and left with the Tab and
        Shift-Tab keys.


        TRailing

        YES or NO
        Default value: YES

        Use TRAILING to tell Visual Compare whether or not trailing space and
        tab characters at the end of lines should be discarded.


        ONEStart

        "string" or 'string'
        Default value: "$$$$$  fileone START  $$$$$"

        If the /C command line option is specified, ONESTART specifies the
        string to be written to standard output at the start of text that is
        unique to file one.  The "fileone" in the default value represents
        the fileone command line argument.

        ONEEnd

        "string" or 'string'
        Default value: "$$$$$  fileone END  $$$$$"

        If the /C command line option is specified, ONEEND specifies the
        string to be written to standard output at the end of text that is
        unique to file one.  The "fileone" in the default value represents
        the fileone command line argument.


        TWOStart

        "string" or 'string'
        Default value: "$$$$$  filetwo START  $$$$$"

        If the /C command line option is specified, TWOSTART specifies the
        string to be written to standard output at the start of text that is
        unique to file two.  The "filetwo" in the default value represents
        the filetwo command line argument.


        TWOEnd

        "string" or 'string'
        Default value: "$$$$$  filetwo END  $$$$$"

        If the /C command line option is specified, TWOEND specifies the
        string to be written to standard output at the end of text that is
        unique to file two.  The "filetwo" in the default value represents
        the filetwo command line argument.


        Working

        YES or NO

        Use WORKING to tell Visual Compare whether or not to display the
        "Working" message.


        Here is an example initialization file:

             CASE
             EXP NO
             TABW 4

        Consider upper-case and lower-case letters equivalent when comparing
        lines, ignore any EMS memory in your system, and use a tab width of
        4.


        Visual Mode                                                        14

        Visual Compare can be run in batch mode by using the /C, /S, or /D
        command line option.  However, most of the time you will probably run
        Visual Compare in visual mode.  In visual mode you can easily see the
        differences between two program source files and you can also
        selectively discard differences in order to quickly undo some of the
        changes that were made.

        If the /C, /S, or /D command line option is not given, Visual Compare
        will enter visual mode.  In visual mode you will be presented with a
        scrollable display of a composite of file one and file two.  The
        composite file consists of lines that are common to file one and file
        two, lines unique to file one (deleted from file one), and lines
        unique to file two (inserted from file two).  Invoke the F1 help
        function to see a list of the available functions and their keys.

        To selectively discard differences, use the F7 remove one function,
        the F8 remove two function, the Del key, and the Minus key to remove
        insertions and deletions from the composite file.  Then invoke the F2
        write function to write the modified composite file to disk.  All
        lines in the composite file except those that have been removed will
        be written to disk.  When you invoke the F2 write function, you will
        be prompted for a composite file name.

        Use the F5 show/hide function to display insertions and deletions
        that have been removed.  Use the F4 number function to mark the
        removed insertions and deletions.  Use the Shift-F7 key, the Shift-F8
        key, the Ins key, and the Plus key to unremove insertions and
        deletions.  To use the Ins or Plus key to unremove an insertion or
        deletion, you must first position the cursor on the removed insertion
        or deletion (the removed insertion or deletion must be displayed with
        the F5 show/hide function).

        If there are lines that are too long to be completely displayed, use
        the right and left arrow keys, the End key, and the Home key to
        horizontally scroll the display.  The End key will scroll the display
        so that the last character of the longest displayed line is visible.

        Lines in file one and file two can be delimited with Cr, Lf, or
        Cr-Lf.  The maximum allowed line length in file one and file two is
        2048 characters.  The maximum number of lines that file one and file
        two each can contain is 16368.  The maximum number of lines that the
        composite file can contain is 16368.

        Visual Compare will normally terminate with a return code of 1.
        However, if Visual Compare determines that file one and file two are
        identical, it will display an appropriate message and terminate with
        a return code of 0.  Also, if Visual Compare encounters an error
        condition while not in visual mode, it will display an appropriate
        message and terminate with a return code of 2.

        Visual Compare uses a comparison algorithm that is described by
        Eugene W. Myers in "An O(ND) difference algorithm and its variations"
        (Algorithmica, 1986, pp. 251-266).  Visual Compare uses the linear
        space refinement of the basic algorithm.
