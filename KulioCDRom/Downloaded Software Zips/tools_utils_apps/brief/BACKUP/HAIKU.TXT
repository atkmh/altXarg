Three things are certain:
Death, taxes, and lost data.
Guess which has occurred.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Everything is gone;
Your life's work has been destroyed.
Squeeze trigger (yes/no)?
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Windows NT crashed.
I am the Blue Screen of Death.
No one hears your screams.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Seeing my great fault
Through darkening blue windows
I begin again
- - - - - - - - - - - -

The code was willing,
It considered your request,
But the chips were weak.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Printer not ready.
Could be a fatal error.
Have a pen handy?
- - - - - - - - - - - -

A file that big?
It might be very useful.
But now it is gone.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Errors have occurred.
We won't tell you where or why.
Lazy programmers.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Server's poor response
Not quick enough for browser.
Timed out, plum blossom.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Chaos reigns within.
Reflect, repent, and reboot.
Order shall return.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Login incorrect.
Only perfect spellers may
enter this system.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

This site has been moved.
We'd tell you where, but then we'd
have to delete you.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

wind catches lily
scatt'ring petals to the wind:
segmentation fault
- - - - - - - - - - - -

ABORTED effort:
Close all that you have.
You ask way too much.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

First snow, then silence.
This thousand dollar screen dies
so beautifully.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"My Novel" not found.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

The Web site you seek
cannot be located but
endless others exist
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Stay the patient course
Of little worth is your ire
The network is down
- - - - - - - - - - - -

A crash reduces
your expensive computer
to a simple stone.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

There is a chasm
of carbon and silicon
the software can't bridge
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Windows is like that
- - - - - - - - - - - -

To have no errors
Would be life without meaning
No struggle, no joy
- - - - - - - - - - - -

You step in the stream,
but the water has moved on.
This page is not here.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

No keyboard present
Hit F1 to continue
Zen engineering?
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Out of memory.
We wish to hold the whole sky,
But we never will.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Having been erased,
The document you're seeking
Must now be retyped.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

The ten thousand things
How long do any persist?
Netscape, too, has gone.
- - - - - - - - - - - -

Rather than a beep
Or a rude error message,
These words: "File not found."
- - - - - - - - - - - -


Serious error.
All shortcuts have disappeared
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.
