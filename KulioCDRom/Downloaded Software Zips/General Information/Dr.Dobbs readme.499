Title: REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
Author: Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike
Keywords: APR99    TEXT PROCESSING    ALGORITHMS
Description: Published source code accompanying the article by Brian W.
Kernighan and Rob Pike in which they examine regular expressions, one of
the most broadly applicable of programmer's tools. Regular expressions
provide a compact and expressive notation for describing patterns of
text. They are also algorithmically interesting, easy to implement, and
highly useful. Also see REGEXP.ZIP.
