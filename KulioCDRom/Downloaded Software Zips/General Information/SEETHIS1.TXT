     Dating Explained
     ================
     
     In the words of Adrienne Rich, a poet who won the National Book 
     Award, the white male dominant culture depends upon "compulsory 
     heterosexuality" to retain "physical, ecnomical, and emotional 
     access" to women. The "interest" which "boys and girls are supposed 
     to show" in dating during their teenage years is only a consequence 
     of "phallocentric social conditioning."

     A women's convention banned the handing out of pamphlets on 
     grounds that "you put the woman you're handing something to in a 
     position where she has to say no, and everyone knows how 
     difficult in this culture it is to say no." 
     
     
     In "Revolution from Within", Gloria Steinem asserts that teenaged 
     girls who dot their i's with little hearts and smiley faces are 
     acting in obedience to "a smiling, always cheerful mask" the 
     patriarchy forces them to wear. 
     
     
     Male vs. Female
     ===============
     
     A group of female artists accused New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art 
     of sexism because 95 percent of the paintings in the museum were by 
     males, whereas 85 percent of the nude statues are female. 
     
     
     Miguel Gonzales of Honolulu was sentenced to an anger-management class 
     after he assaulted his girlfriend. He showed up drunk for one class, and 
     his instructor allegedly became enraged and beat him, leaving him brain 
     dead. The instructor, Charles Mahuka, was on parole for attempted murder. 
     
     
     Happy Couples
     =============
     
     When Maria Ramos and Darryl Johnson decided to have sex on a New York 
     subway track, their passions were interrupted by an oncoming train. 
     Johnson suffered a dislocated pelvis, neck injuries and lost part of 
     his left foot; Ramos was unhurt. The couple sued the transit authority 
     for $10 million, alleging "carelessness, recklessness and negligence" 
     because the transit authority sent a train along a rarely used track 
     without warning commuters of the change.

     A letter to the advice column of the *Syracuse Herald American*, 
     March 5, 1995: 
     
     Dear Pat: My therapist has encouraged me to write you and share a 
     ritual I conceived of to celebrate my decision to lead a single 
     life. Next month I will be 30. Instead of being depressed about 
     hitting "the big 3-0," and being unmarried, which is something I 
     have decided against, I'm having a different kind of wedding 
     party. In front of close friends, I plan to marry myself.
     I will ask for their blessings, anticipating some will read poetry, 
     others may play a song on the guitar, or read something they have 
     written especially for me. Then I will place a beautiful jade band 
     on my "ring finger," symbolizing my marriage to myself. 
     
     
     
     Instruction and Advice for the Young Bride

     To the sensitive young woman who has had the benefits of proper 
     upbringing, the wedding day is, ironically, both the happiest and 
     most terrifying day of her life. On the positive side, there is the 
     wedding itself, in which the bride is the central attraction in a 
     beautiful and inspiring ceremony, symbolizing her triumph in securing 
     a male to provide for all her needs for the rest of her life. 
     
     On the negative side, there is the wedding night, during which the bride 
     must pay the piper, so to speak, by facing for the first time the terrible 
     experience of sex. At this point, dear reader, let me concede one shocking 
     truth. Some young women actually anticipate the wedding night ordeal with 
     curiosity and pleasure! Beware such an attitude! A selfish and sensual 
     husband can easily take advantage of such a bride. One cardinal rule of 
     marriage should never be forgotten: GIVE LITTLE, GIVE SELDOM, AND ABOVE 
     ALL, GIVE GRUDGINGLY. Otherwise what could have been a proper marriage 
     could become an orgy of sexual lust. 
     
     On the other hand, the bride's terror need not be extreme. While sex its at
     
     best revolting and at worse rather painful, it has to be endured, and has 
     been by women since the beginning of time, but it is compensated for by the
     
     monogamous home and by the children produced through it. 
     
     It is useless, in most cases, for the bride to prevail upon the groom 
     to forego the sexual initiation. While the ideal husband would be one 
     who would approach his bride only at her request and only for the 
     purpose of begetting offspring, such nobility and unselfishness 
     cannot be expected from the average man. Most men, if not denied, 
     would demand sex almost every day.
     The wise bride will permit a maximum of two brief sexual experiences 
     weekly during the first months of marriage. As time goes by she should 
     make every effort to reduce this frequency. Feigned illness, 
     sleepiness, and headaches are among the wife's best friends in this 
     matter. Arguments, nagging, scolding, and bickering also prove very 
     effective, if used in the late evening about an hour before the 
     husband would normally commence his seduction. Clever wives are ever 
     on the alert for new and better methods of denying and discouraging 
     the amorous overtures of the husband. A good wife should expect to 
     have reduced sexual contacts to once a week by the end of the first 
     year of marriage and to once a month by the end of the fifth year of 
     marriage. 
     
     By their tenth anniversary many wives have managed to complete their child 
     bearing and have achieved the ultimate goal of terminating all sexual 
     contacts with the husband. By this time she can depend upon his love for 
     the children and social pressures to hold the husband in the home. 
     
     Just as she should be ever alert to keep the quantity of sex 
     as low as possible, the wise bride will pay equal attention to 
     limiting the kind and degree of sexual contacts. Most men are 
     by nature rather perverted, and if given half a chance, would 
     engage in quite a variety of the most revolting practices. 
     These practices include among others performing the normal act 
     in abnormal positions; mouthing the female body; and offering 
     their own vile bodies to be mouthed in turn. Nudity, talking 
     about sex, reading stories about sex, viewing photographs and 
     drawings depicting or suggesting sex are the obnoxious habits 
     the male is likely to acquire if permitted. A wise bride will 
     make it the goal never to allow her husband to see her 
     unclothed body, and never allow him to display his unclothed 
     body to her. Sex, when it cannot be prevented, should be 
     practiced only in total darkness. Many women have found it 
     useful to have thick cotton nightgowns for themselves and 
     pajamas for their husbands.
     These should be donned in separate rooms. They need not be removed during 
     the sex act. Thus, a minimum of flesh is exposed. 
     
     Once the bride has donned her gown and turned off all the lights, she 
     should lie quietly upon the bed and await her groom.
     When he comes groping into the room she should make no sound to guide 
     him in her direction, lest he take this as a sign of encouragement. She 
     should let him grope in the dark. There is always the hope that he will 
     stumble and incur some slight injury which she can use as an excuse to 
     deny him sexual access. When he finds her, the wife should lie as still 
     as possible. Bodily motion on her part could be interpreted as sexual 
     excitement by the optimistic husband. If he attempts to kiss her on the 
     lips she should turn her head slightly so that the kiss falls 
     harmlessly on her cheek instead. If he attempts to kiss her hand, she
     should make a fist. If he lifts her gown and attempts to kiss her anyplace 
     else she should quickly pull the gown back in place, spring from the bed, 
     and announce that nature calls her to the toilet. This will generally 
     dampen his desire to kiss in the forbidden territory. 
     
     If the husband attempts to seduce her with lascivious talk, the wise 
     wife will suddenly remember some trivial non-sexual question to ask him. 
     Once he answers she should keep the conversation going, no matter how 
     frivolous it may seem at the time.
     Eventually, the husband will learn that if he insists on having sexual 
     contact, he must get on with it without amorous embellishment. The 
     wise wife will allow him to pull the gown up no farther than the 
     waist, and only permit him to open the front of his pajamas to thus 
     make connection. She will be absolutely silent or babble about her 
     housework while he is huffing and puffing away. Above all, she will 
     lie perfectly still and never under any circumstances grunt or groan 
     while the act is in progress.
     As soon as the husband has completed the act, the wise wife will 
     start nagging him about various minor tasks she wishes him to 
     perform on tomorrow. Many men obtain a major portion of their 
     sexual satisfaction from the peaceful exhaustion immediately after 
     the act is over. Thus the wife must insure that there is no peace 
     in this period for him to enjoy. Otherwise, he might be encouraged 
     to soon try for more. 
     
     One heartening factor for which the wife can be grateful is the fact that 
     the husband's home, school, church, and social environment have been 
     working together all through his life to instill in him a deep sense of 
     guilt in regards to his sexual feelings, so that he comes to the marriage 
     couch apologetically and filled with shame, already half cowed and subdued.
     
     The wise wife seizes upon this advantage and relentlessly pursues her goal 
     first to limit, later to annihilate completely her husband's desire for 
     sexual expression.
