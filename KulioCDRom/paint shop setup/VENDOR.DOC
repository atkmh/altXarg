Description:
------------
    Paint Shop Pro is the only Photo Retouching, Painting, Image Format
Conversion, and Screen Capturing program you will need.

Features include:

Painting - Paint Shop Pro supports 8 different brushes including pen, pencil,
marker, crayon, chalk, charcoal, airbrush, and paintbrush to edit an existing
image, or create your own.  A user defined brush allows you to combine
elements of any of the other brushes to create a unique effect, while the
fill tool allows easy filling of large areas.  No need to worry about errors
since the undo brush allows mistakes to be easily corrected.

Photo Retouching - Work on existing images with the clone brush for easy
duplication of image areas, or with the magic wand for quick selection of
similar areas for manipulation.  Also provided are a push brush for easy
touch-up, a sharpen brush to enhance detail in small areas, and a smooth
brush for easy blending.  You can also use the eye dropper to pick up and
analyze a color from an image.

Image Enhancement and Editing - Paint Shop Pro allows you to perform flip,
mirror, rotate, and crop operations, plus the ability to add borders and
frames, or resize and resample your image.  Paint Shop Pro ships with 20
standard image filters plus any user definable filters you create.
Also included are 12 image deformations, including skew and circle.
Filter and deformation browsers are also provided. Paint Shop Pro supports
Adobe compatible plugin filters.

Color Enhancement - With Paint Shop Pro, you can alter the hue, saturation,
lightness and RGB levels.  Adjustments to brightness and contrast and changes
to highlight, shadow, and midtone can also be made.  Palette editing and
direct palette mapping allow global changes to multiple images.  Gamma
correction and color reduction are also provided.

Image Browser - The browser, using thumbnails, allows you to visually search
directories for those easy to lose images.  The thumbnails may optionally be
saved for super-quick access.  You can also select multiple images to be
loaded directly into Paint Shop Pro for editing. Complete file management
functions allow you to easily keep track of images.

Batch Conversion - When it comes to converting a large number of images from
one format to another, Paint Shop Pro has made it as easy as possible.  All
messages during the conversion are sent to the log window for unattended
operation, and the log may be saved to a file for later inspection.

Paint Shop Pro also provides image viewing and printing functions to provide
you complete control over how your images appear.  Support for TWAIN
compliant scanners is also included.  Paint Shop Pro provides support for the
following image file formats:

      BMP, CDR, CGM, CLP, CUT, DIB, DRW, DXF, EPS, GEM, GIF,
      HPGL, IFF, IMG, JIF, JPG, LBM, MAC, MSP, PCD, PCX, PIC, 
      PBM, PGM, PNG, PPM, PSD, RAW, RAS, RLE, TIFF, TGA, WMF,
