			  Definition of Shareware

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying it.
If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are required to
register it (or purchase the licensed version as in the case of
Paint Shop Pro).

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and retail software, and the
copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as stated
below. Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like retail
authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are
good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute
the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group. For example,
some authors require written permission before a commercial disk vendor may
copy their Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You should find
software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's retail or
Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because you
can try before you buy. And because the overhead is lower, prices are lower
also. Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.


			   ASP Ombudsman Policy

This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle
works for you. If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem with
an ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to help. The
ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member,
but does not provide technical support for members' products. Please write to
the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442-9427 or send a
CompuServe message via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536

	      Installing Paint Shop Pro

    Before you can use Paint Shop Pro you have to run the Paint Shop Pro
setup program from Windows so it will work properly on your computer.
You cannot just copy the files from the Paint Shop Pro disk to your hard
disk.  The files on the distribution disk are packed in a special way to
save space.  The setup program unpacks those files and builds them on
your working disk.

    1. Start Windows.
    
    2. Place the Paint Shop Pro Disk 1 in the Floppy Drive.

    3. Activate Program Manager
	Make Program Manager the active window.

    4. Open the File Run Dialog Box
	To open the File Run Dialog Box, select "Run" from the Program
	Manager's File Menu.

    5. Enter the Command Line
        Type in the dialog box the command that will run the
        Paint Shop Pro setup program.

	If your floppy disk goes in your Drive "A", type:
	    A:SETUP
	If your floppy disk goes in your Drive "B", type:
	    B:SETUP

	Leave the "Run Minimized" box un-selected, and click the
	"OK" command button (or press "Enter").

    6. Enter the Drive and Directory
        This is the location that you want your Paint Shop Pro files to
        be placed.  It will suggest a drive and directory of "C:\PSP".

        If you want the Paint Shop Pro program files installed on into
        a different directory, just double click on the directory
        name you would like to install to or type in a new one.

    7. Paint Shop Pro Setup will unpack the necessary files and place
	them into your directory.  The status of the operation will be 
        displayed as the setup program does this work.  If Paint Shop Pro
	came on more than one disk, during the unpacking of the disks you 
	will be requested to insert the next disk.

    8. You will be asked if you would like to add the Paint Shop Pro
        icons to the program manager.
 
	Select "No" if you do not want Paint Shop Pro added
	    to your program manager.

	    Select "Yes"  to have the setup program automatically build a 
	Paint Shop Pro icon and add it to your program manager.

    9. The setup program will notify you when the installation is
	complete.
